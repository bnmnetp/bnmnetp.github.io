&lt;p&gt;Apparently the boat hit some rocks and flipped over.  With the power of the falls and that river its amazing that only two people died.  &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/travel/tourists-killed-as-raft-flips-under-iguazu-falls-20110322-1c4f9.html?from=smh_sb"&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/travel/tourists-killed-as-raft-flips-under-iguazu-falls-20110322-1c4f9.html?from=smh_sb&lt;/a&gt; Its worth following the link to the article as it has an awesome picture of a rescue working being lowered from a helicopter that gives you a sense of the scale of these falls.&lt;/p&gt;

We are excited to get back to our friends and family in Decorah, yet we have had so much fun on this cruise, and we have actually met some great people as well.  Some of these people get to stay on the ship for the next leg of the cruise and as we think about our long day tomorrow and our overnight flight we are a bit jealous that we don't get to go through the Panama canal, and then fly home from Fort Lauderdale.  I'm amazed that I could even consider staying onboard for another two weeks, but we've learned that its really all about pacing (note to self, next time do not buy the unlimited drinks package.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cruise critic message boards really provide a great service.  Not only can you find good reviews and recommendations of the non-ship excursions, but we've met a lot of fun people, and have been able to enjoy excursions with people that we met online prior to the cruise. So to Carol and Mike, and Carol and Ralph, and Scott and Gai, and Kristine and Craig (our aussie friends)... Thanks!!  To Jonathan and Nancy and Jo, we look forward to the final Martini rankings, Aloha!  And to Shila and Yogi, Kim and Rico, Rachel and Howie, thanks again for the fun dinners!  Hopefully we'll cross paths with some of you again on a future cruise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, where have we been?  Here's the super-fast summary of our travels:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decorah to MSP with Jenkins, Thanks for the ride guys!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MSP to Dallas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dallas to EZE (Buenos Aires)  cross town transfer to Jorge Newberry and then on to Iguazu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two fantastic days at Iguazu falls.  If you are looking at this cruise or planning a trip to South America, do not skip Iguazu.  The views are fantastic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iguazu back to BA and on to the ship!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BA to Montevideo, Uruguay&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Montevideo to Punta del Este&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Punta del Este to Puerto Madryn -- Desert like climate but great penguins and sea lions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puerto Madryn to Cape Horn and the Ushuaia (Ushuaia gets my vote for favorite city of the trip)  Its the southernmost city of the world, and the hiking and views on our hike in Tierra del Fuego national park were just phenomenal!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ushuaia to Punta Arenas... OK, but not that spectacular.  If you haven't seen penguins by now, you should definitely do the trip here to see the penguins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Punta Arenas to Puerto Montt.  The port area is not spectacular, but once you get out into the country or to one of the other smaller neighboring cities its great.  Beautiful scenery.... second favorite city.  Of course the zip line ride really made this stop worthwhile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puerto Montt to Valparaiso to Santiago&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Santiago to Dallas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dallas to MSP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ride home with Sandy Larsen!  Wow gone 16 days and no parking charges at the airport!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other stuff:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While on board, we used up 435 minutes of internet time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We drank 2 bottles of wine :-)  or more...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane won $700 at the craps table&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We really enjoyed many of the shows onboard the Celebrity Infinity!  We had become pretty much jaded about cruise line entertainment, but the quality here was really high.  I missed having a magic show, but the music was mostly really great, except for the aging former Argentine star, who just doesn't realize its time to hang it up.  When you are on a cruise ship and you have to start your show with a video about how great you used to be, that is not a good sign!  Travis, from Nebraska, you rock.  The a cappella group top shelf was great too.  It was hard to listen to this recently graduated group of young guys without thinking about Kaia's future as a musical performer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No summary would be complete without some room pictures, so here are a few pics of our Celebrity Suite.  This suite will be redone when the ship is Solticized in November, but we thought it was perfect for this cruise.  Not only was the room spectacular, but our Butler, Teguh, was the most Amazing person.  No job was too big or too small, he really made our cruise seamless.  From sneaking into the room before I was awake every morning so that my coffee was hot and fresh on the table, to organizing a part for 20 in our room one night.  He was the best!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PJOMhXDI/AAAAAAAAAPY/PsUFK601Bv8/IMG_2543.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2543" title="IMG_2543.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PJpXrJJI/AAAAAAAAAPc/kB9mgIbKAyQ/IMG_2546.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2546" title="IMG_2546.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PK0iEIUI/AAAAAAAAAPk/kZFodvDVsJ0/IMG_2556.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2556" title="IMG_2556.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-PKMDxmxI/AAAAAAAAAPg/H6iOyzx5yqw/IMG_2549.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG 2549" title="IMG_2549.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane says I can type and read at the airport tomorrow, so I think its time to get dressed for dinner one last time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2808293707145995482?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Southamerica2011</category><category>Travel</category><guid>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2011/03/cruise-wrapup-part-i.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cruise Wrapup Part II</title><link>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2011/03/cruise-wrapup-part-ii.html</link><dc:creator>Brad Miller</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been back in Decorah for less than 24 hours, its been a little more than 48 hours since we got off the cruise ship in Valparaiso.  It was great to get a good nights sleep last night after having an overnight flight from Santiago to Dallas.  Boy do I wish I could sleep on airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Celebrity debarkation process was about as painless as you could make it. We woke up, showered and dressed, got some coffee at the Cova Cafe, checked our email one last time, and then walked off the ship.  Like Buenos Aires, the port in Valparaiso is not really designed for cruise ships, so we got off the ship and then took a bus through the containers to the actual terminal.   We found our luggage right away and realized that this process was so efficient we still had about 45 minutes to wait before our guide, Mac, from &lt;a href="http://www.labicicletaverde.com/"&gt;La Bicicleta Verde&lt;/a&gt; It was a little odd this morning because Chile was supposed to go off daylight savings time at the same time the US was supposed to go on daylight savings.  So, in one day we would go from being 3 hours ahead of home to just one hour.  Strangely the government of chile decided at the last minute not to go off daylight savings time, so some people were really off.  Mac showed up just after 9:00, and we got our tour underway.  We started by exploring the hills of Valparaiso.  Its an old shipping town, started when Nitrates were a big natural commodity that was shipped out of here.  Before the Canal, and before artificial nitrates had been invented.  So there are many beautiful old shipping houses owned by the british that have been converted into small hotels.  Here you can see one last view of our ship from the hills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2559.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lgbWQR_I/AAAAAAAAAPs/qYK_mU8OK4g/IMG_2559.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2559" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued on past the first Lutheran Church in Valparaiso, and then had to avoid a pack of street dogs.  All chilean cities are full of street animals that are well feed and mostly well behaved.  The problem this morning was there was one female in heat and four males that were trying to get her attention.  Things got a little violent, so we headed off in the opposite direction hoping to lose the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac told us that the day before this whole area of the city had been without power.  Now as you can see from this picture Valparaiso has a very modern system of electrical distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2566.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lhdhCiAI/AAAAAAAAAPw/T80lkZzXk3c/IMG_2566.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2566" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told that whenever there is a power loss, rather than trying to untangle the mass of wires and fix the problem, they simply find an area of the city that has power and then run a new wire to the blacked out area from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the hill tour we headed down the coastline to visit some of the beautiful coastal towns, suchas Vina del Mar.  This would be an awesome place to come back and visit on a land tour.  The beaches are spectacular, and there are some really awesome restaurants looking right out over the water.  Mac got us number one at the most popular restaurant along this stretch.  People literally line up outside this restaurant waiting for a table.  Something that is unheard of in Chile.  We started off with a couple of apetizers:  Machas ala parmesan (razor clams smothered in a parmesan cream sauce.)  The only way to sum up this dish is:  To Die For!  We also had Camerones pil pil (little shrimp scampi).  Then for the main course we had freshly prepared fish.  They have about 7 different kinds of fish on the menu, each one with several different preparations.  I had Albacora (swordfish) grilled, and Jane had the Corvina (chilean sea bass) also grilled.  We had a side of Arroz and thought we were in heaven.  What a great last meal of the trip.  Oh, lest I forget , I also had my first Pisco Sour.  Pisco Sour is a great chilean drink made of a distilled wine (kind of like brandy) served with lime juice and simple syrup.  Just one please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2569.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-liHkJ7eI/AAAAAAAAAP0/PeTTyYLJ17E/IMG_2569.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2569" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our delicious lunch we headed out to wine country.  The Casablanca valley is between Valparaiso and Santiago.  We stopped at the Emiliana Organic Vineyards, for a wine tasting and a walk around the vineyards.  We had a great wine steward, named Joshua, who served us samples of their premium Emiliana Adobe line.  This is sold in the United States under the Emiliana Natura label because of  a trademark dispute with the Adobe software company.  Please lawyers find something more productive to do with your time.  The highlight was their Gewurtztraminer, its not nearly as sweet as the German Gewurtztraminers and was very refreshing.  In addition to being organic they also practice Biodynamics (you'll have to look it up).  This sounds like a lot of hokum to me, but you can't argue with the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2574.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-ljPq7YOI/AAAAAAAAAP4/6L6V9pT56Iw/IMG_2574.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2574" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what trip would be complete without some cute animals.  The vineyard also raises Alpacas, which we learned are part of the Camel family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2585.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lj20NJvI/AAAAAAAAAP8/DyB6X7faf6c/IMG_2585.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2585" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vineyard tour over, our last stop was the Santiago airport.  We had lots of time to kill, since we got there about 5pm and our flight wasn't supposed to leave until 10:05.  Of course at 5:00 the American Airlines counters were not even open yet. Then at 6:00 when they opened it was a mad house.  hundreds of tired cruisers all anxious to get home, and all accustomed to being pampered for two weeks were now forced to stand in extremely long lines like so many commoners.  It was not pretty.  An interesting thing about flying out of Santiago is that all the outgoing flights leave in the evening, this is partly because you want to time your flight to get in to the states at a decent hour of the morning.  Say 6:00 AM or so.  But all the incoming flights get in to Santiago at 7 or 8 in the morning anyway, so why not have an outbound flight at 10AM?  By Chilean law, all outbound flights must have a complete mechanical inspection within 12 hours of their flight by a Chilean mechanical team.  The reason for this law dates back to 1972 when the Uruguayan rugby team crashed in the Andes and resorted to cannibalism to stay alive.  The Chilean legislature wanted to ensure that nothing like this would ever happen again so they passed this inspection law.  The result is that the flights that leave in the evening are never delayed for mechanical reasons, because they've had all day to inspect and fix everything.  Nice, makes you feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that brings us as far as our last flights, which were pretty uneventful.  A bit of turbulence somewhere between Santiago and Dallas is about the only thing worth mentioning.  This was an awesome trip.  Thanks again to all the great new friends we made on board the ship for making it a fun time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, this is not going to have a big impact on our trip. Out at sea, the tsunami is nothing but a big swell that we would ride up and over like any other large swell.  Its only when it gets toward land that it becomes the giant wall of water you see on the news. The captain is going about business as usual and we are on our way out of the harbor at Puerto Montt as I write this.  We have about 650 nautical miles from here to Valparaiso, and tomorrow we will spend a relaxing last day at sea.  If we were the tsunami, we would be able to get there in just a little over an hour!  According to news reports the wave traveled from japan toward Hawaii and the west coast of the US at over 500 mph.  The pictures of Japan on the news are just unbelievable, but again it appears that distance will sufficiently weaken the tsunami to the point where we will not be affected at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets turn our attention to our fabulous day here in Puerto Montt!  We got to check off a bucket list item today.  What could that be you ask?   Zip Lining!  The highlight of todays tour was going to the top of a volcano, and then riding a series of zip lines to the bottom.  When we arrived on the pier this morning it was quite overcast and the owner of the tour company warned us that with the rain from last night and the wind today we might be out of luck.  But we took off in our little bus and headed for Lago Llanguihue, this is a huge vacation lake that sits below the volcanoes.  And when we arrived at the base of the ski lift on the volcano it appeared that we might in fact be out of luck.  Here's a view of what the side of the volcano/ski area looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2473.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqX0iHLHrI/AAAAAAAAAO8/JMf5VBQolOI/IMG_2473.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2473" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were clearly in and above the cloud line, and it was really eerie to see the wisps of clouds, that looked like steam rising from the dark sides of the volcano.  Our guide told us that we would not be allowed to go because of the wind.  So, we just hung out for a while looking at the clouds and suddenly we noticed that the sky towards the top was starting to clear.  Suddenly the chair lift even started running.  Our guide came out and said OK team lets head down and we'll go into Puerto Vargassafsf for some shopping and a nice lunch.  Wait!  a couple of the women (including jane) said.  Can't we at least ride up the chair lift?  Of course I'm thinking you guys are mad, why would we want to ride higher up into the clouds to just see more clouds.  So our guide told us to wait and she would check.  Miraculously, now the 'experts' were out checking the zip lines to see if they were safe.  The verdict came back that it was safe, so a few of us decided to follow the original plan and go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached the top of the ski lift we were treated to the following view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2496.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqX8LWOwjI/AAAAAAAAAPA/Zuh96Wv5Jtc/IMG_2496.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2496" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly you can see the clouds had dissipated and we had a fantastic view of the top of the volcano, and its glacier.  It took us a few minutes, as the guy working at the top of the lift did not speak any english, but we eventually located our zip lining guides.  They got us into our harnesses and led us to the top of the launching pad for our very brief (10 seconds?) safety briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:   hold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Si&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:  break&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Si&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:  No touch the cable, only here and the break&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  Si&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And off you go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's Jane and our friend Scott before we got our helmets.  Those harnesses are certainly stylish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2484.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqYAyClIJI/AAAAAAAAAPE/8oIy5boEdg4/IMG_2484.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2484" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now here's Jane on her first run of the day.  Yes kids thats your mother hanging by a thread from a long thin piece of cable..  Don't worry she's having the time of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2486.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqYEx22OBI/AAAAAAAAAPI/3vNQbo2GBJc/IMG_2486.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2486" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now here's one of me coming in for a landing after our longest ride.  The span of this ride was 600 meters!  The total ride time was about 38 seconds which means our average speed was 15.78 meters/second or about 35 mph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2519.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXqYOBwCnPI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/g945yXZ8Cis/IMG_2519.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2519" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, we got to go on four different runs, each was great and very exhilarating.  We had an adrenaline rush for a good hour after we were all done, talking excitedly in the bus all the way back down the volcano.  A great day and a lot of fun.  Can't wait to try it again sometime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got back from the workout room.  walking up the stairs was quite an adventure.  At times I felt like I was floating up two to three stairs at a time, and at other times, I felt like I was carrying an elephant on my back as I was trying to go up a single stair.  Bootcamp was postponed this morning due to the high seas.  I decided to go ahead on run on the elliptical, which was kind of fun with all the dipping and plunging the ship was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be at sea today, and tomorrow, although later today and all of tomorrow we will be cruising through the Chilean Fjords. The Fjords will be much calmer than the open ocean.  I'm not sure whether or not to even attempt to go to bootcamp workout in these high waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we were in Punta Arenas.  It was our first stop in Chile.  We did not do any kind of excursion or tour.  We just took the tender to shore and walked around the town a bit.  There was a nice park square with trees, and a statue of Magellan, and handicrafts.  Apparently you are supposed to kiss the toe of Magellan and you will come back again, but with the crew having you sanitize your hands every five minutes, I can't imagine why anyone would want to kiss the toe of a statue and share the germs of a hundred other travelers that way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were in town we found an internet cafe, where for the price of a cup of coffee we could get all the free internet we wanted.  It was nice to have some high speed internet for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just got back from a tour of the bridge.  It was very interesting and one of the officers confirmed that the wind was very strong this morning.  He said the maximum gust was 99 knots.  Thats about 113 mph for you non-nautical types.  So what do you do when you have a twelve story floating building and the wind is blowing against one side of the building at 113 mph?  Several things, it turns out.  The ship has stabilizers that can be deployed to counteract the forces of the wind.  These protrude out of the ship under the water at an angle like long wings that are under the water.  In addition there is water ballast that can be pumped from one side of the ship to the other to counteract the wind and the seas.  So when you consider that we had a strong current, 15 foot waves, and strong winds gusting to over 100 mph its amazing how little rocking and rolling the ship actually did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of photos I snapped while we were on the bridge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are back we are also getting ready to host a little party in our room for some of the people we've met on board.  The party will start here, and then we'll also visit some of the rooms and suites that others have.  This is a great way to see what kind of room you might like to have the next time you come on board.  Here's a shot that I took on the balcony of our friends Jonathan and Nancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were very lucky today and got a day when the seas were relatively calm, and the skies were quite clear.  Here you can see Jane and I on the east side of the island.  In the background you can kind of make out the weather station.  There is also the Chilean flag, and the Albatross Monument.  This is a monument to all the sailors who have died trying to navigate around Cape Horn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2232.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYnSVjj3WI/AAAAAAAAAOg/FnC1yYaIGOk/IMG_2232.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2232" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather around the cape is very unpredictable.  In the span of less than an hour it went from the rather nice, as seen in the picture above to the somewhat sinister as seen below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2263.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYnXn-5tkI/AAAAAAAAAOk/Y0NjY6jXQu8/IMG_2263.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2263" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I think to myself,  here we are on this enormous cruise ship, you'd have to be insane to do this on the size ship that the early explorers used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to catch you up a bit.  We've been at sea the last two days.  Its very relaxing except that I caught a nasty cold and have been mostly just laying around and taking hits off my inhaler.  Between the bouts of chills, I've gone to a few of the excellent lectures they do on board the ship.  Two retired college profs who get to sail around the world with celebrity giving lectures on the science and nature of the area we are visiting.  Not a bad retirement gig if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jane has been a demon in the casino.  She's been rolling the dice at the craps table and is way ahead of our meagre $200 gambling allowance.  Now you might be thinking that there is still plenty of time to lose it all.  The thing is our strategy is to squirrel away the winnings and then go back to the table with the original amount again the next night.  I know some people would say double down, you don't have anything to lose (except the original $80 that we planned on losing anyway)  But our Norwegian Lutheran heritage just doesn't roll that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2348.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm0kGV83I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jsqcdTXP2Nk/IMG_2348.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2348" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ushuaia is the southernmost city in the world we are not as far south as you might imagine our latitude is only as far south as Washington DC is north, so there are no issues with permafrost or any of the other problems that plague the far north cities.  Interestingly though, there are glaciers very near the city, and we cruised by them and hiked near them today.  Ushuaia is located on the Beagle channel.  This is the channel that the famous ship carrying Charles Darwin discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day in Ushuaia was full of hiking with people we've met from Cruise Critic.  There were 11 of us that had joined in a private tour with Christine and Craig from Australia.  Our driver and guide, Edgar, was very pleasant, and knowledgeable.  He stayed awake the entire trip!  He hiked with us and pointed out interesting plants and things along the way.  Our main hiking was in the Tierra del Fuego National Park.  Here are a couple of photos to give you an idea of how pretty it was.  Jane and I are going to try to find an Internet Cafe in Punta Arenas so hopefully with some speedier connectivity I can get some larger versions uploaded to Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2299.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm3kkQ49I/AAAAAAAAAOM/MHuuLnWYEtM/IMG_2299.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2299" width="400" height="265"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2314.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm6gp-nXI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/rF5bL41pAa0/IMG_2314.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2314" width="398" height="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things I discovered on the hike was how similar this area is compared to northern minnesota.  Its striking how the effects of the glaciers leave exactly the same marks even though we are in completely different parts of the world.  In some places you would think you were on the shores of lake superior instead of standing next to the Beagle Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hiking in the national park all morning, we got in the van and drove to the ski area above the city.  Here we were able to take a ski lift up the mountain to another hiking area.  If we had more time we could have continued to hike up the mountain to the glacier.  Sadly, the hike was too long and we didn't want to miss the ship!  While we were doing a short hike at the top of the lift we were lucky enough to see an Albatross soaring in the sky.  These birds are huge, with wingspans of up to 3.5 meters!  Sadly it was too far away to get a decent picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a shot of the view on the way down the ski lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2377.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYm-BBpIAI/AAAAAAAAAOU/ke3BdLTab4k/IMG_2377.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2377" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here you can see our ship on the pier with the city in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2379.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXYnBD4fP7I/AAAAAAAAAOY/JUX0O3IUTZ4/IMG_2379.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2379" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I would say that Ushuaia is my favorite city of the cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

Ferdinand?  Ferdinand?  anyone? anyone?  Yes, Ferdinand Magellan!  I'm so clever.&lt;br&gt;I know I'm sounding a little snarky about the tour today, but it really turned out just fine.  because we were just the two of us on our own tour, we got to the Penguin colony well ahead of the masses, in fact we had the place all to ourselves, and that made it worth it right there.  Would I have liked some more insightful commentary?  Sure.  But the kid was sincere and earnest so its hard to be too upset with him.  If I'm upset with anything its with Forastero tours for sending us a rookie.&lt;br&gt;Anyway, without further ado, here are some penguin pics for you!  yes, we were up close and personal with the penguins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2142" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIbpLUmLQI/AAAAAAAAANo/0d9U-mlpX5U/IMG_2142.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2142.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;This little guy was not happy.  I think he was hungry and Mom was not coming through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2156" border="0" height="102" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIbvXmGNaI/AAAAAAAAANs/SOYW4Y-2cdY/IMG_2156.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2156.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2159" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIb2W-QNSI/AAAAAAAAANw/iIn_xRa97pk/IMG_2159.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2159.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the Penguins we continued further up the road to Punta Norte where we saw both Sea Lions and Elephant Seals.  Punta Norte is the only place in the world where you can see the Elephant seals.  At other times of the year, and at high tide, you also stand a chance of seeing an Orca coming into try and catch a baby Sea Lion, but no such luck today.  Anyway, here's a shot of the beach, you can see the Sea Lions down below.  the Elephant seals are way on the far right end of the coast here and we could see them with the binoculars, but not so well with the camera lens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2164" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIcCNltwGI/AAAAAAAAAN4/b4NId_TBBrU/IMG_2164.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2164.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After watching the Sea Lions we found a nice place to sit and enjoy some sandwiches for lunch.  While we were eating lunch the friendly neighborhood Armadillo (piche en espanol) came around hoping we would share with him, or her Im not sure how you tell with Armadillos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2195" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TXIcI0hzdhI/AAAAAAAAAOA/ZyUENnHzcdw/IMG_2195.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2195.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last and final episode with our young guide happened on the way back to the ship.  We had to take the exact same route back to the ship that we followed to get to Punta Norte, but lets just say the ride seemed shorter for some people than for others.  Yep, he actually &lt;strong&gt;fell asleep&lt;/strong&gt; on the ride back!  I think the driver was ready to reach across, open the door and push him out.&lt;br&gt;Its funny how all of our excursions involve both a driver and a guide.  In each case we are led to believe that the driver does not speak english.  In this case I'm pretty sure the driver was much more experienced than the actual guide, as he seemed to know many of the other guides at Punta Norte.  Furthermore I think he understood and probably spoke english just fine.  He also did an excellent job of scanning the countryside and the road ahead for interesting animals.  We could tell that he was the one who would spot them and then tell our guide what was coming up.  His job today was to give junior some feedback on his first outing.  I'm pretty sure he got an earful!&lt;br&gt;The day ended on a very positive note.  Jane got on a roll at the craps table and ended the night over $400 ahead.  She made a lot of other people at the table very happy too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1832043447776667251?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Southamerica2011</category><category>Travel</category><guid>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2011/03/my-name-is-ferdinand-and-i-ll-be-your-waiter.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Biking Punta Del Este</title><link>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2011/03/biking-punta-del-este.html</link><dc:creator>Brad Miller</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Punta Del Este has about 10,000 regular inhabitants, even though when you look at the picture of it you could easily imagine that it hosts ten times that number.  This is because Punta Del Este is a huge vacation getaway for much of South America.  All of the apartments in the high rise buildings are vacation homes.  Punta Del Este itself is mostly situated on a big peninsula with beaches on both sides.  The beaches on the west side are at the Platta river, the same one that starts in Brazil and flows through the Tigre Eelta north of Buenos Aires.  The beaches on the east are on the Atlantic ocean, and you can see the fresh and salt water mix together off the tip of the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2071.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_cGp7TLI/AAAAAAAAANM/sGh4oYd-uk0/IMG_2071.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2071" width="600" height="397"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't have anything in particular planed for our day in Punta del Este, so we just took the tender ashore with the idea that we would walk around and check things out.  However when we got off the ship and started our walk through town, there it was, Bike Tours!  One lone woman holding a bike tour sign, of course we had to check it out.  Her name was Alice and she said she could take us on a two hour tour of the city, tell us about the history and highlights of the area, and of course we would do it all on bike.  Yay!  The price was very reasonable too, so here's my digital shout-out to &lt;a href="http://www.biketoursuruguay.com"&gt;Bike Tours Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; Its a great way to see the town, and Alice even has other longer tours that will take you north into some of the other outlying areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we got our bikes, helmets, and water our first stop was the most famous work of art in Punta del Este.  The "hand in the sand"  This was a sculpture that won a big art contest sponsored by the city back in the mid 1980's.  It is literally a giant stone hand coming out of the sand on the beach.  Here's Jane and I in front of the middle finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2063.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_ecn92YI/AAAAAAAAANQ/FPCA-Mjyz20/IMG_2063.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2063" width="400" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued our tour down the atlantic side enjoying the sites and sounds of the beaches.  The picture at the top is taken looking north back up the beach.  When you get to the point of the peninsula there is an observation deck to go out on, where you can enjoy the view looking back up the river as well as out to sea.  On the atlantic side there is an island where many hundreds of sea lions live, that is another tour for another day...  Some of our dinner table mates took that tour and said it was fun but pretty smelly when you get in amongst all of the sea lions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to the point our guide pointed out the island, and a small marker right off the point, and then another landmark off the the west.  According to the guide there is a large but rather narrow triangle  described by these three points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this triangle is one of the places on earth that has amazing energy.  Oops, now I'm thinking what kind of strange new age mumbo jumbo guide did we get ourselves mixed up with.  But stay with me for a minute.   This triangle also encompasses the Punta del Este lighthouse, seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2085.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_gpL7RTI/AAAAAAAAANU/jmT4GtB7xdY/IMG_2085.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2085" width="400" height="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, right next to the lighthouse is a little park area with a compass rose made out of stone.  You can see Jane standing on the compass rose facing south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="IMG_2086.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW9_jUpn5lI/AAAAAAAAANY/Q5eD6bKF00A/IMG_2086.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2086" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the remarkable thing.  When you stand on the center of the compass rose and begin to speak you experience something really amazing.  Its like your voice echos inside your head in a really strong resonant way.  When our guide told us about this I was extremely skeptical.  I could just hear her telling me,  "What you couldn't feel it?  Its so strong I can't believe you didn't experience the power...."  But when I stood there and started talking it was amazing.  I'm not sure what causes it, but I did do some googling and apparently there are some strong magnetic forces that converge in the Punta del Este area that have been scientifically investigated.  When I get home I'm going to have to do some more research to see if I can figure out what might cause this internal acoustic effect.  (unless of course Mike has it figured out for me first)  If you have any theories of your own, please leave them in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued to bike around the peninsula, and up the river side.  We stopped at the fish market to see some sea lions, getting a late lunch, and from there we also had a great view of our ship as seen through many of the ships in the marina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a day where we had absolutely nothing planned this turned out to be a great adventure.  Seeing a city by bike is great, it gives you a good perspective and allows you to see the sites from outside, rather than being stuck inside a car or van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are at sea the whole day, on our way to Puerto Madryn.  There are lots of activities scheduled, and lots of time for reading and relaxing today.  We are looking forward to a nice quiet day -- After we go to our first boot camp workout!  The ship is also hosting a get together for all of the people on the Cruise Critic message boards, so that will also be a chance to meet some people in person that we have only communicated with electronically.  So, goodbye for now, I'll give you an update in a couple of days when we are through Puerto Madryn.&lt;/p&gt;

We had a white blend, along with a rose, a merlot, and a red blend.  We asked to try their Chardonnay and their Malbec, unfortunately they only had the chardonnay left for tasting; it was good but I actually liked the white blend we tried originally better.&lt;br&gt;After the tasting, we were all tired... Big surprise right!  But we had a little more touring left to do.  We climbed montevideo's only large hill where we were treated to a great view of the harbor and our ship.  Its right in the middle of the photo below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 2032" border="0" height="266" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TW6skNRUbgI/AAAAAAAAANE/HZDR9sXvcwM/IMG_2032.jpg?imgmax=800" title="IMG_2032.jpg" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall it was a nice tour.  Last night was the first formal night on the ship, and it was fun to get out the old tuxedo again and enjoy some good food and a nice show, iBroadway.  Jane and I can both check frog legs off the list of foods we have tried.  Guess what?  They taste like chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6271555744286021478?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Southamerica2011</category><category>Travel</category><guid>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2011/03/montevideo-uruguay.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
