It was at Bobby Flay’s Mesa Grill.  This blew me away. Although I love a good steak at a restaurant, usually I can do just as well at home.  But this steak was amazing.  This was a two inch think tenderloin that was perfectly medium rare from edge to edge! The very outside edge was seared perfectly too.  Whoa, I thought at the time,  how did they do that?  How can you have a steak so uniformly done?  The answer of course is Sous-vide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve been reading the books, like &lt;em&gt;Modernist Cuisine at Home&lt;/em&gt;, and lots of articles on “Serious Eats”, I’ve seen it done on &lt;em&gt;Chopped&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Iron Chef&lt;/em&gt;.  Then the other day I got a Kickstarter notice about the new Anova Precision Cooker.  Its an immersion circulator that lets you do sous-vide cooking without one of the big fancy sous-vide appliances.  This just clips on the edge of one of your big pots, and away you go.  Alton Brown would love it.   Unfortunately this new fancy one that even connects to your iPhone will not be available  until later this year, so I decided to give the Nomiku a try.  It was the highest rated of three options on Amazon, and was Prime Eligible.  If I really like it I figure I can always upgrade to the Anova later.  So here's my setup for an afternoon of high-tech cooking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/SousVideSetup.JPG" src="http://reputablejournal.com/images/SousVideSetup.JPG"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind sous-vide cooking is that you can cook at a lower temperature for a longer period of time.  bringing the water and your food into equilibrium.  Whats cool about that is that you can cook a steak to exactly 132 degrees, and you can leave it go for an extra hour or two and it will remain at the perfect medium rare done-ness.  You can also cook chicken. without heating it to 165 degrees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What!?  I thought?  this cannot be.  But then I started to do some reading and once again science rocks.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/sous-vide-basics-low-temperature-chicken.html"&gt;http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/sous-vide-basics-low-temperature-chicken.html&lt;/a&gt;  It turns out that you can kill all the nasty bacteria at 135 degrees, it just takes longer!  Like 90 minutes!  Heating chicken to 165 kills the bacteria too, instantly.  But it also gives you dry chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other aspect of sous vide is that you use a vacuum sealer to seal your food in plastic before you immerse it in the water.  This allows you to season the food and add aromatics to your bag.  Yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this also precipitated a quick trip to the hardware store to get a FoodSaver vacuum sealer.  Yay more kitchen toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m trying a steak.  I sealed it up and dropped it in.  In a couple of hours I’ll get out the cast iron skillet and heat it up good and hot, so that I can sear the meat when it comes out.  A glass of Rombaur and a baked potato and I’m all set.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Cooking</category><guid>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2014/05/the-sous-vide-adventure-begins.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2014 21:36:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Chef Challenge  in Etosha</title><link>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2012/06/top-chef-challenge-in-etosha.html</link><dc:creator>Brad Miller</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;After a long day of driving and viewing the animals we pulled into our accommodations at Halial Rest Camp in Etosha National Park.  Although it was a long dusty day of driving we saw many game animals (see my related post) on the drive so it was well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had made the decision in the morning to have a Braai for supper tonight, so we bought steaks and pasta and some supplies for making sauce at the Pic-N-Pay in Oshikati.  Based on the descriptions of our Bush Chalets we knew that we had an outdoor grilling area (the Braai) along with cooking supplies and utensils in the room.  The Bush Chalets are just fantastic, ours was two bedroom, with a living area and separate toilet and shower areas.   All of which looked quite new.  The only problem was that the cooking supplies were missing!  We all had some plates and bowls and silverware, but no pots or pans suitable for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COOL!!  This is like a Quick Fire challenge on Top Chef.  We got some firewood and kindling from the gift shop and talked Joey out of his lighter for five minutes to get the fire going.  We slit open the steaks and added some namibian barbecue dry rub to them along with a little salt and pepper, let them site for a while and the steaks are taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do you cook pasta and pasta sauce with no pots and pans.  Well, we all had hot pots in our room for boiling water to make coffee or tea.  If you can boil water you can cook noodles.  To make the sauce we just opened the cans (thank God for swiss army knives) and set them next to the fire.  Add a helping of noodles to the bowl, spoon out some tomatoes and some pureed tomatoes and a few mushrooms from their respective cans and viola you have a nice sauce for your noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add in some raw veggies, and some grilled red and yellow peppers and you have a regular feast.  Of course a couple of glasses of wine at happy hour probably helped make it all taste better than it was but it will definitely go down as one of the more memorable meals of the trip.  After supper we continued to sit around the fire and talk and share great memories with each other.  It was a great night, thanks friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Cooking</category><category>Namibia</category><guid>http://reputablejournal.com/posts/2012/06/top-chef-challenge-in-etosha.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
