    <p>Dear Apple,<br><br>You lost a sale today.  I know its just one less iPhone you are going to sell, and in the grand scheme of things does not amount to anything.  I suppose its not really your fault, and as a loyal Apple customer its much easier for me to blame AT&amp;T than you.  Still, it makes me sad to have to tell you this.  I waited as long as I could for AT&amp;T to expand their network in my direction. I've hung on every Verizon rumor for two years.  Finally after enduring a year of carrying my iPod touch in the same pocket as the mind numbingly horrible Motorola Crush I bought an HTC Desire yesterday.  Android!! I never thought I would see the day.<br><br>Here's whats even worse, I like it!  It has some great apps Gmail, Calendar, and many apps that I already love on my iPod Touch and iPad:  Dropbox, Evernote, 1Password, Kindle, Facebook, Twitter, Weather, Stocks, and a 5, yes 5, megapixel camera!  I already love the gps, so the location aware apps work, I love the WiFi and the Bluetooth.<br><br>I'm going to miss OmniFocus, but I carry around my Ipad almost everywhere I go so I don't think I'll miss it that much.<br><br>So Apple, I'll remain a loyal customer, at least for now.  I'm going to continue to develop my app for the iPad, I still love my iMac and my MacBook Pro.  But if US Cellular comes out with a decent family data plan in the next month or so you may lose two more sales as the rest of my family follows me into the smartphone world.<br></p>

    <p>So today I sat in my office and looked over at my library of books, probably about 700 books all together.  The top half of the library contains my cookbook collection and lots of other non-fiction books.  The bottom half is largely science fiction, some paperbacks that I've had for 30 years,  The Lord of the Rings trilogy for example.  There were also several large stacks of books on the floor because the shelves are full.  Jane is wanting me to do something to get the books off the floor.  Even though she doesn't spend that much time in my office so I don't know why it bothers her, but she's right the piles have been accumulating and its time to do something.<br><br>Suddenly it hit me, I could let all of the paperbacks go.  I've been saving them for years because they are my favorites and maybe I'll read them again, or maybe I just like to look at the shelves and see my old favorites sitting there. I'm not sure what the precise reason is, whatever it is I'm over it.  I just realized that if I did want to read them again, I would no longer want to do it by holding a real book in my hand.  I realized that just like all of my old '80s music that I had on cassette tape these are relics of my past, and if I did want to read them again I would be happier to download them to my iPad and read them in the kindle app or iBooks.  But, fat chance that the iBooks store would have any of these old favorites.  I prefer the iPad over the dedicated Kindle because it saves me one device.  Plus until now the kindle required cell coverage that I don't have.<br><br>So, here, for posterity, and maybe to remind me in the future if I come back and read this post instead of staring at bookshelves, is a random walk through the lower half of my library. If you have suggestions for what I can do with the paperbacks let me know.  If you read this list and have suggestions for other authors you think I would like, definitely let me know.<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Rober Sawyer, every book ever written by him except for the current WWW series which I bought in electronic form from the beginning.  Factoring Humanity, Calculating God, the Hominid Series, great ideas<br><br>
</li>
<li>Isaac Asimov, The robot books, and the entire foundation series.  These books took me through college.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Stephen R. Donaldson, the Thomas Covenant Chronicles.  Covenant is still one frustrating guy whenever I think about these books.  Although I notice that there are some new additions to the series that are out in eBook form...<br><br>
</li>
<li>Dan Simmons, the Hyperion, Endymion series.  The Shrike was one scary monster.<br><br>
</li>
<li>David Brin, Despite the absolutely dismal movie the Postman is still a favorite in how it forshadowed the web.  I also have some Brin on the upper half of the library, The Transparent Society is an excellent book to get you thinking about privacy in the digital age.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Orson Scott Card, the Enders Game series... I loved all of these books, and I even like some of the more recent ones where he goes back and fills in some missing pieces from the perspective of other characters.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Connie Willis, The Doomesday Book is awesome as are many of her other stories although none have captivated me as much as that one.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Frank Herbert, The Dune series of course.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Robert Heinlien, Stranger in a Strange Land and others.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Mary Doria Russel, The Sparrow.  This is one of my all time favorite books, in fact I even made my Paideia students read it last year.  I'm sure they thought I was off the deep end for making them read Science Fiction in a serious class like Paideia but Oh well.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Robert Russo, not science fiction but a great writer.  I like all of his books, but teaching at a small college, I get tears in my eyes from laughing so hard when I read Straight Man.<br><br>
</li>
<li>And speaking of non-science fiction books, Jon Hassler, this guy captures small town midwest living so well.  From Staggerford to Rookery Blues they are amazing.  I miss him, and I miss Connie Helgen who recommended him to me.  After our trip to Ireland this summer I've been longing to go back and read a Green Journey again, but I just checked and its not available in the Kindle store.  Horrors!<br><br>
</li>
<li>James Halperin, The Truth Machine, and I just read an article this morning about a group out in california that is using MRI as a new lie detector.  Anyway, read this book.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Roger Zelazny, the whole Amber Series, kind of a disfunctional family but the whole series is fun to read.<br><br>
</li>
<li>John Grisham, hmmm why did I save all of these??<br><br>
</li>
<li>Carl Sagan, Contact.  I read this way before the Jodi Foster movie.  That was just a bonus for a young geek who loved her in the after school specials.<br><br>
</li>
<li>J. R. R. Tolkien, a boxed set of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.  I don't think I can part with these.  I still remember reading these late at night with a flashlight under my blanket.  I've still never been able to make it through the Silmarillion though.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Douglass Adams, such a loss, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series.  I swear I can open up any of these books to a random page and start reading and I'll be laughing in no time.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Neal Stephenson, Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon.  I've never had the energy to make it through the Quicksilver books, but I have Anathem on my iPad so we'll see.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Gordon R. Dickson, Dorsai, the Chantry Guild, The Final Encyclopedia<br><br>
</li>
<li>Larry Niven, the Ringword Books, and other books with Jerry Pournelle (a Mote in God's Eye)  I still remember looking forward to reading Pournelle's Chaos Manor column in Byte magazine every month<br><br>
</li>
<li>Robert Charles Wilson, Spin, Darwinia, The Chronoliths, and others.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Vernor Vinge, A Fire Upon the Deep, a Deepness in the Sky<br><br>
</li>
<li>Ursula K. LeGuin, The Dispossessed, and the Earthsea books.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Mary Stewart, The Crystal Cave series that retells the legend of King Arthur.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br>I also discovered a rather interesting section on the shelves devoted to historical fiction, but I'll leave that for another time.  I just wanted to mention it in case you've concluded that I'm hopelessly one dimensional.<br><br>I would also say that I've discovered that computer science reference books work very well as ebooks.  I've been teaching myself to program my iPad and I have several good references in electronic form.  Its nice to have them open on my big screen, and its easy to find examples when you can search.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1345374799381159586?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""></div>

    <p>So I'm working on an app during my sabbatical that has an iPad component and an online Google App Engine component.  The Google App Engine part is half web based and half web service based.  Of course this means that the local client part has to be able to authenticate itself to the Google App Engine before it can communicate and do useful stuff.  Finding good reliable examples of how to do this is surprisingly hard.  For the Objective C code I'm working on I found a nice set of classes that do the trick for you here:  <a href="http://github.com/cameronr/GoogleAppEngineAuth">On Github</a>  For Python I found some example code on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/101742/how-do-you-access-an-authenticated-google-app-engine-service-from-a-non-web-p">stackoverflow</a>.  However it was not really in a reusable form.<br><br>The basic outline of what you have to do is as follows:<br><br>1.  Login to https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin  This will give you an auth token.<br>2.  Use the token you gained in step 1 to login to your Google App engine application or service.  When you have successfully logged in to your service google will set an ACSID cookie for you to use when you make subsequent requests to your service.  This prevents you from having to login each time you make a web service request.<br><br>I've taken some ideas from both places mentioned above and have created a Python class for logging in and accessing app engine services from Python.  To use this module you just need to import it and create a GoogleAppEngineLogin object.  Once the object is created you can use the open method on the object to access further services.  The open method is just a convenience wrapper around urllib2.urlopen but it also makes sure that your cookie has not expired before it makes a request.  If you have comments or suggestions for how to improve the code please let me know via email or leave a comment.<br><br>The code is reproduced below, but you can also just download the file from git clone git@gist.github.com:36b1c45ed39298178907.git<br></p>
<pre class="prettyprint" style="overflow: auto;"><br>import getpass<br>import urllib<br>import urllib2<br>import cookielib<br><br><br>class GoogleAppEngineLogin(object):<br>    """<br>   Logging in to an App Engine Account (when you use google users) is<br>   a two step process: First you must login to Google generally.  This<br>   gets you an auth token.  The auth token is used as part of a<br>   request to login to your app/service During the login process for<br>   your app/service the server sets a cookie with the name of ACSID,<br>   it is this cookie and its value that serves as the authentication<br>   token for your own service/app.  So, for future requests you need<br>   to give the server the cookie as part of your request.  Handling<br>   cookies can be a bit tricky if you haven't had some experience with<br>   it but luckily Python's cookielib module makes it all pretty<br>   automatic.<br><br>    This class takes care of the whole login process for you, and then<br>    gives you a simple helper to access the URLs for your service.<br>    The helper function makes sure the cookie is still valid and<br>    passes on the request along with the cookie.  Technically you<br>    would not even need to use the helper function, you could use<br>    urllib2 directly to access your service but this seems a bit<br>    neater to me.<br><br>    Some of this code was inspired by and lifted from an example on<br>    stackoverflow.com, but that was all in-line code my contribution<br>    is to add some error handling and encapsulate the whole thing<br>    inside a class to make it easier to include in my/your own<br>    programs.

    <p>Here's a quiz for you... What do deer, old cars, a saw mill, and black bears all have in common?  These are all things I regularly see on my rides around polk county.  The countryside by our cabin is some of the best riding around, every road is paved and very lightly travelled.  I can ride around any number of lakes and have all kinds of flexibility to make a route that is anywhere from 12 to 50 miles long.  Bone Lake, Half Moon, Pipe, Balsam, Little Blake, Butternut, these are a few of the lakes that I loop in and through on a regular basis.<br><br>So, the other night I took my camera for a ride and focused more on the picture taking that the riding.  Here's my favorite shot from the night and you can find the rest of them <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2064788&amp;id=59203846&amp;l=2defc9fdd3">here:</a><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TEcaYq9NsuI/AAAAAAAAAH4/fbqhEL_1Zj0/IMG_1264.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_1264.jpg" title="IMG_1264.jpg" border="0" width="518" height="345"><br><br>Incidentally, this picture illustrates where the bear comes in to the picture.  This little pond is at the bottom of a little hill and around a nice little corner.  One morning a came coasting down the hill and around the corner to see a black bear, he would have been right in the bottom right corner of the picture.  I don't know which of us was more surprised!  The bear took off one way and I took off as fast as I could up the hill and past the pond.  We've never seen each other again.<br><br></p>

    <h3>Why I'm writing this on a 27 in iMac</h3>

<p><br><br>I'm almost lost as I stare at the screen to write this post.  27 inches is a lot of screen real estate to work with, but boy do I love this new iMac!  It is fast, fast, fast.  I never thought of my Macbook Pro as being a slow machine but this is crazy fast in comparison.  Typesetting my textbook project used to take minutes on the MBP, now it takes just a few seconds.  Why all this speed?  Maybe it is due to the 8 GB of memory and the 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 processor.<br><br>The more interesting question is why am I replacing my MBP with an iMac?  The answer, in a word, is iPad.  After trying out my iPad for a few days back in April I was convinced that I would no longer need a notebook, and that my money would be better spent on a desktop.  After traveling in Europe for 28 days with the iPad as my only computer I am convinced I was right.  The iPad is the best computer ever for traveling.<br><br></p>
<h3>On the Plane</h3>
<br>Flying with an iPad is great.  We had a seven hour flight and I had loaded several movies and a bunch of TV show episodes onto my iPad, I've never had a more enjoyable long flight.  I can't sleep on planes, so it was great to be able to watch two movies and a few episodes of Merlin on the flight over.  My Bose noise canceling headphones make the experience even better as they do such a great job of blocking out the jet noise.<br><br>When I wasn't watching a video I was reading.  I had several books loaded on both iBooks and Kindle apps.  I really wish there was more selection in the iBooks store, as I'm finding they rarely have the book I want, so the kindle app gets used more frequently.<br><br>Finally, if I wasn't watching or reading I had several games loaded to keep me entertained.  I like Scrabble, Strategery, and Fieldrunners the best, although I did play a few games of chess against tChess Lite.<br><br><h3>On the Ground</h3>
<br>While on the ground I found several apps to be incredibly useful.  WeatherBug is awesome for checking the weather forecast while away, its easy to add new cities and the coverage in the UK, Ireland, and Scandinavia is excellent. <br><br>For keeping up with the daily technology news I really like Early Edition.  It is beautiful in that it takes away all the hassle of marking things as read or whatever, every day you just get a nice newspaper like layout of the new articles that have come in since yesterday.  I love how this keeps me from getting overwhelmed with stuff when I get a few days behind.  If someone comes out with an Early Edition like reader for the mac I'm almost sure that would replace my longtime favorite, NetNewsWire, on my desktop.<br><br>Every day I also used the Photo app, it was so easy to transfer pictures from my Canon 7D to the iPad. After the transfer I could delete the really bad pictures right away, and it was great to be able to look at the photos I had taken on the iPad size screen rather than the little screen on the camera.  I really wish apple would make it possible to rate and organize pictures on the iPad that would make it even better.  Now that I'm home, I still have to go through the process of picking the best of the 1000 pictures I took and organizing them into an album.  If you could do that on the iPad then I could pick the best of each day as I go along.  I also bought PhotoForge for the iPad because there were a couple of times that I wanted to upload a photo to Facebook, and its impossible to edit the photos on Facebook using Safari on the iPad.  PhotoForge is great and very easy to use.<br><br>The other app that got a lot of use was Evernote.  prior to leaving my wife had prepared notes for each day of the trip, along with pdf maps and other info about each destination.  Although she had saved them as notes in our shared Dropbox account I found it to be much easier to drag them all into Evernote rather than the hassle of marking each document as a favorite in Dropbox so I could have offline access.  I really wish Dropbox would improve the iPad and iPhone clients to make it easier to keep things available offline.<br><br>Finally, I wrote a blog entry almost every day of the trip using BlogPress.  I purchased an Apple Bluetooth keyboard for writing purposes and I really love it for writing longer blog entries.  For Facebook and email the onscreen keyboard is fine, but for longer writing the keyboard was awesome, and it proved to be very durable and easy to carry along in my daypack.  BlogPress itself worked like a champ.  It was a breeze to choose pictures from the Photo app to drop into the blog, and it also worked very well offline.  A lot of times I would write the blog entry when I wasn't in wi-fi range and then just post it when I found some free wi-fi.  I also like how BlogPress makes it easy to make a Facebook posting every time I publish a blog entry.  That was a great way for friends and family to know there was something new to read.<br><br>Incidentally I did not find myself wishing for a 3G iPad at all.  I was always able to find some kind of wi-fi no matter where we were.  Every hotel we stayed in had wi-fi available, not always free, but I would say in 90% of the hotels it was free.  If it wasn't free in the hotel it was not too hard to find a pub or restaurant nearby that did have it available, for the price of a coffee or drink.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2083102877647968900?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""></div>

    <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...  This morning the sky was mostly cloudy, and there was almost no wind.  So I went along with Dan, Brian, James, and Joanna to do the mast ride.  This was an optional 8 mile ride for the before breakfast crowd.  The main feature of this ride was an 840 (Padraic said 250, but the GPS showed the lie) foot climb.  Most of that 840 feet was in the last 3/4 of a mile.  For those of you from Decorah just imagine the First Lutheran hill extended to 3/4 of a mile.<br><br>The view from the mast was fantastic, we could see the ocean and a couple of beautiful lakes.  The hill was so steep, and the roads were just a little bit damp, that I actually had to walk my bike the last 100 yards, because I could not get enough traction when I was sitting on the bike and pedaling!  The ride down was almost as exciting, in fact it seemed quite a bit more dangerous than the ride up as it was difficult to keep your speed down without skidding all over the place.<br><br><br></p>
<center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/64.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_64.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>After finishing that ride I was very ready for my breakfast back at Rosleague Manor.  I had a ham and cheese omelet with some of the best croissants ever.  To wash down the omelet I had a glass of grapefruit juice and a cup of black coffee.  The manor employs a great French chef, and they have an exchange program to bring over young people from france to learn Irish service customs.<br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/65.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_65.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>After breakfast there was another optional ride.  From Rosleague we rode to Letterfrack, then out on the Connemara loop, past Molly the pirate queen's castle, and then on to Renvyle, Tulley, Tulley Cross, and then back to Letterfrack by a different road.  Once again we had fantastic views, we saw a small vertical wind turbine, and learned about Grace O'Malley the pirate queen.  Back in the 1500's she was a very powerful woman who enjoyed plundering the english royal ships that were in turn plundering all of Ireland.  She and queen Elizabeth met to try and resolve the issue but as long as Elizabeth was unwilling to stop plundering Ireland, Grace O'Malley was unwilling to stop sinking and plundering their ships.  Apparently they ended up agreeing to disagree, but I'm sure it was an exciting meeting.<br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/66.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_66.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>We met up with the rest of the group in Letterfrack for lunch at Currachs.  Although three courses were offered as part of lunch most of us could not imagine eating more than one course and maybe a bit of dessert.  Many of us had the Irish pizza and it was quite good.  A nice change from the last couple of days.  I also had a chocolate chip cookie for desert which was excellent but a bad choice as the chocolate muffin was clearly superior.  Kaia had snicker bar pie which would have been a close second or third I'm sure.  Jane and Josh had apple pie and ice cream.<br><br>Here's where the story of the day takes a turn for the worse.  Just as we were finishing up, the weather forecast for the day came true.  Rain after noon.  We rode to the Kylmore Abbey in a torrential rain.  At one point we came out from behind a wind break and I was nearly stopped in my tracks by the strength of the wind.  My little water resistant biking wind breaker was doing nothing to stop this rain and I was wet and chilled by the time we got to the Abbey.  The Abbey was pretty impressive in the oppressive weather, and I'm sure it would have been brilliant in good weather.<br><br>After the Abbey I seriously considered buying a new waterproof winter coat, but instead I borrowed one of Padriac's extra rain jackets.  We had 17 additional miles to get to Ballynahinch (pronounced like bal-in-the-hinch if you say it really fast) Castle.  After a half a mile we were all soaked through completely, my shoes were completely soaked, my pants were soaked, all of my layers were soaked.  And the headwind was horrific.  After a while we realized that there was no possible way we could get any wetter, so we might just as well accept our fate and enjoy the ride.  Once again, I'm sure that in reasonable weather it would have been beautiful.  As it was I was still nice.<br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/67.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_67.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>Now we are at the castle, showered, dried, and warm.  Our clothes have been sent off to be dried, and the porter will collect our shoes to leave them in the boiler room to dry over night.  All is well, as DuVine takes good care of us.  Our only remaining decision for the day is whether to stay here at the castle and eat at the pub or to go into town and try one of the restaurants there.<br><p class="blogpress_location">Location:<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Ballynahinch%20castle&amp;z=10">Ballynahinch castle</a></p>

    <p>Well, today is our last official day of vacation.  Tomorrow is a day of travel back to Dublin and then we wake up and head to the airport to see Kaia off to France and the rest of us to Chicago.<br><br>After our rain soaked day yesterday we were thrilled to wake up to see the sun and big puffy white clouds today. What a difference the sun makes!  Our departure this morning was slightly delayed as we were still drying shoes and clothing from yesterday, and (I suspect) because most of the group was in Roundstone partying at the pub until late last night.  The Miller family stayed and had dinner at the castle last night as we are all showing the wear of nearly four weeks on the road.  <br><br>I can't imagine what the maid must have though when she came into our room this morning.  I had been sitting on the floor drying 3 pairs of shoes with the blow drier; the shoes I've worn every day for the last 3 weeks, Josh's tennis shoes, and Jane's walking shoes.  The smell was indescribable.<br><br>When we did take off we headed out toward Roundstone, a beautiful little seaside village which is becoming very popular among the well to do here in Ireland.  When you come into town you go right past the house of the guy who wrote the original River Dance. From Roundstone we made our way along the coast toward Ballyconeely where we had our first 'table stop' of the day. Padraic was busy setting out a table with fruit and granola bars and juice for us.  <br><br><br></p>

<br>We only had a little further to go to get to Clifden, so we decided to do the Sky Drive loop before lunch rather than after.  That turned out to be a great decision as the weather cooperated perfectly and we were treated to magnificent views of the sea.  Based on the color of the sea you would think that you were in the Caribbean not Ireland!  As you might guess the Sky drive was a bit of a climb but it takes you right out to a point where you can see ocean in three different directions. Here's the Miller family at our stop on the point.<br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1062.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1062.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>Of course by this time our guides had already schemed to set up another table stop.  They had gone to the store in Clifden and bought some more Bulmers cider, this was the new berry flavor that Padraic had not had before so he was even more excited than usual for us to give it a try.  We toasted a great trip and all of our new found friends.<br><br>The ride back into Clifden was mostly downhill, but by this time we really were ready for some food.  We ate at E.J. Kings pub, Jane and I had the chicken curry, Kaia had ravioli, and Josh had a club sandwich.  I think Padraic was a little disappointed that we had strayed from traditional irish fare but by this time our palate's were ready for something a little more spicy.  We all had to laugh at Josh during lunch because we were talking about the weather and how lucky we were that it wasn't raining like it was yesterday.  I said yes, it only rains in Ireland on days that contain a 'y.'  Jane and Kaia laughed and the conversation moved on.  Suddenly, from out of the blue, Josh says, "wait every day has a 'y' in it."  We still love him.  <br><br>By the time we finished lunch it was almost 3:00 and it was time to head back to the Castle.  The Miller family took off a little ahead of the pack, and then Josh and I separated from Jane and Kaia, we made it back in record time.  It was our flattest ride yet.  The interesting thing about riding through the bog is how similar it looks to the prairies of Southern Minnesota, except where the glaciers flattened all the granite in Minnesota there were no glaciers here so the granite still stands in small hills and big chunks of rock sticking up out of the landscape.<br><br>Josh and I were so fast  that I missed the last table stop.  A little bit of Jameson Irish Whiskey to toast our final ride.  Not being a whiskey fan, that did not hurt my feelings except that Padraic insisted on pouring me a glass in the parking lot of the Castle when he caught up to us.  <br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1063.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1063.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>Tonight we have our final group meal in the main dining room here at the castle.  Based on the look I had at the menu last night it will be a feast.  This has really been a great way to finish up our vacation.  The people in our group have been a lot of fun, and DuVine really lives up to their motto, Bike, Eat, Drink, Sleep.  In the photo above we have in the front row, Dan, Craig, Kaia, Laurie, and Joanna.  In the back row we have Patty (Dan's wife) Bobby and Brian, Brad and Jane, Josh, and James (Joanna's fiance)<br><br>Not in the picture are our two amazing guides for the week Padraic and Kirk.  These guys are amazing and made for a really fun week.  Its easy to forget that every time we were having fun and sitting around enjoying ourselves they were tending to every minute detail to make sure that our trip was a success.<br><p class="blogpress_location">Location:<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Ballynahinch%20Castle&amp;z=10">Ballynahinch Castle</a></p>

    <p>We are staying in a castle!  Ashford castle to be precise.  It's about an hour outside of Galway and it's absolutely beautiful.  We arrived yesterday afternoon with our DuVine Adventures guides Kirk and Padraic.  Yesterday was mostly about checking to the room, getting our bikes fit, and getting to know our fellow cyclists.  There are a total of 12 of us on the trip and everyone is really nice.  There are no other young adults on the trip but so far everyone has been very welcoming of Josh and Kaia.<br><br>This morning we woke up to what the irish call a soft rain, we might call it a mist but I like the irish term better.  It really is so soft that you forget about the precipitation until you are totally soaked by it.  We had a nice breakfast here at the castle and then Josh and I went golfing at the nine hole course, and Jane went along with some of our fellow cyclists to a falconry class.  It was amazing, they got to wear the leather glove, and the falcon would take off and land from their arm.  Meanwhile Josh and I were sharing a set of clubs and getting soaked while playing some golf in Ireland.  The course was not too hard, and on the par three I almost got a legitimate hole in one, see my previous post on St. Andrews!<br><br><br></p>
<center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/0.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_0.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="187" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>At noon we took off on our first true ride of the tour.  We cycled up the road a bit to stop for lunch in a small pub.  The only problem was that the soft rain had not abated, and according to our head waiter at the castle, "If its still raining at 11, its probably going to keep raining all day."  It really was a soft rain and although we were all quite wet at our lunch stop we dried out rather quickly as well.  Our destination for the afternoon was Joyce Country Sheepdogs.  Here we Met Joe Joyce who is a sheep farmer and breeder of working dogs.  If you have seen Marley and Me, you have seen Joe's sheep and one of his dogs (not Marley -- Its the scene where the sheep are blocking the road)<br><br>Joe showed us how the dogs herd the sheep and how they respond to his verbal or whistled commands.  He lives in a beautiful stone house, and his sheep roam the mountains across the lake from his home.  When he needs to bring the sheep in for something, which happens five times a year, he brings his dogs across the lake and he commands them using his whistle from a boat where he has a better view.  These dogs are amazing, they WANT to work so hard for him they go crazy when its not their turn to herd the sheep.  I should say it rained on us the last couple of miles to Joe's house so we were all like drowned rats when we got their.  Thankfully while we were there the rain let up and the sun started to break through.<br><br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>

<br>The ride back was even more beautiful than the ride out, thanks in large part to the lack of rain.  Its amazing how green and beautiful the Irish countryside is.  The mountains go directly down to the lake shore and the lakes themselves are incredibly beautiful.  Tonight we had our second amazing dinner at the castle, this dinner was much less formal than last night's sport coat and tie affair, but my seafood chowder was to die for, the fish and chips were good, and then the desert, a white chocolate rhubarb tart was amazing.<br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/3.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_3.jpg" border="0" width="210" height="281" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>Tomorrow we have about 40 miles to bike to our next destination and another delicious dinner, I'm already looking forward to it, and I hope we will have sun all day tomorrow.<br><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4754161074077029100?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""></div>

    <p>We woke up this morning in Ashford Castle to a clear blue sky.  After a breakfast, we were left our luggage outside our door and loaded our backpacks into the van.  We were on our way for 40 miles of cycling at 9:00 this morning.  We only rode about a half a mile before we made our first stop at the Ashford Abbey.  This is a very well preserved Abbey.  We learned that the most well preserved churches are from the church of Ireland, since in times past there were many interesting rules applied to the catholics.  For example if you were catholic you could only build your church out of wood.  If you were catholic you could not pass down your family land to one member of the family it had to be divided equally among all of the family members.  So for a large catholic family it did not take many generations before the land was subdivided into sections so small that they were useless for farming.  While we were at the Abbey reading gravestones,  I did discover a typo on one from the 1800's  the stone read that the couple buried was survived by "there" daughter.<br><br><br></p>

<br>Biking with DuVine is a bit different from the way I bike at home.  When I bike at home I just ride and I keep riding until I'm done.  With DuVine we ride, then we stop for snacks.  These snacks always involve an important local beverage.  We've tried some delicious Irish Stouts, a Smithwicks Ale, along with a some wonderful Bulmers Cider.   Anyway, as I was saying, the weather today was fantastic, no wind, and some great sun.  Here's a picture of Loch Fuehy (lake phooey) You could really see the reflection of the hills in the water it was so still.  <br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1061.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1061.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>Our first snack stop today was at the edge of Irelands only Fjord.  Does anyone know what it takes for a body of water to be a fjord?  Mike keep your hand down, anyone else?  No, well to be a fjord, you must be fed by the Ocean, and must be formed by a glacier.  For our stop we had some Bulmers pear cider (I hope someone in Decorah can get this) and some fruit.  After a little rest we continued up the road to our lunch stop.  We had a specially designed menu just for us.  I had some seafood chowder, a crab sandwich (right fresh from the fjord) and some Creme Brule for desert.  Below you can see a picture of the fjord.<br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1062.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1062.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br><br>We had one pretty good climb today, just before our lunch break.  Jane had a little problem with her chain at the bottom of the climb and ended up talking with one of the local farmers for quite some time before she got a ride in the van to our lunch stop.<br><br>Another fun feature of riding in Ireland is that occasionally some sheep will be right on the road.  Here you can see Jane herding a small flock out of our way.<br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1063.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1063.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="210" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br><br>After our lunch we continued along the fjord until we turned onto the coast.  We stopped to check out the peat bogs, and have a little afternoon snack of some Harps Lager and nuts.  Once again the views were just amazing.  Now we are at Roseleague Manor.  There were a lot of rolling hills today so we are just chilling, catching up and email and blogging until our next meal.  when DuVine says their motto is "Bike, Eat, Drink, Sleep" they really are not kidding.  We've had fantastic food everywhere so far, and I feel like every calorie I bike off, I immediately consume at the next snack stop.<br><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2131677003684979934?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""></div>
