  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Bezos likes to talk about technology and civilization and where we are at in terms of the analogy that we are still at &ldquo;Day One.&rdquo;  He recently observed that we are so early in Day One that the alarm clock hasn&rsquo;t even gone off yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>With new technologies, it’s very tempting to think that you’re further along than you are. But usually, you’re more primitive than you think. My guess is we’re still pretty primitive. We as a society, as a civilization. I doubt we have figured out the new technologies very well yet. At Amazon, we’re doing our part in trying to push things forward, but I have the feeling it’s Day One.</p></blockquote>

<p>And so it was that we found ourselves in the building called Day One South, meeting with our very gracious host Sam. This was a great way to start, and although Sam had not been prompted in any way about what to say, he hit on some of key themes for the students to take away from the course:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Passion</strong> &mdash; You are going to work long hours, so you want to find a place to work and a job to do at that place where you are passionate about whatever it is.  If you aren&rsquo;t excited about it, keep looking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Culture</strong> &mdash; This part of the discussion brought back both great memories and ulcers in my stomach from the days when Amazon was a Net Perceptions customer.  I&rsquo;ve never been pushed harder than I was by Jennifer Jacobi (JJ) when she was my primary contact at Amazon.  She challenged us, held our feet to the fire, threatened to dump us, and ultimately helped us create a better product.  Apparently this is how Amazon treats all its suppliers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk</strong> &mdash; High tech companies are full of risk takers.  Sam was no exception as a young graduate who simply moved to Seattle in search of a job.  Years later he is still at Amazon.  Many more years later than he expected.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After our meeting with Amazon we found a coffee shop where we could take over a large table and had some group discussion.  I told my own story of Net Perceptions, which I should probably write down here soon, and tried to relate my own experience with the themes I want the students to look for over the next three weeks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the short tribute speech I gave last Friday at the University of Minnesota.  Actually, I had to edit my speech to be shorter than this, so I thought I would just post this longer version, plus it contains some fun old images I dug up that I didn’t get to show.
 </p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7367/10693282536_78e4e228a2_n.jpg" alt="" /> </p>

<p>Hi, I’m Brad Miller.  For those of you who don’t know me, I was one of John’s PhD students, and a co-founder of Net Perceptions, but more importantly he was someone I admired, respected, and called my friend.  </p>

<p>Now, I  still use Instant Messaging quite a bit, and its a way that John and I connected over the years.  But,  its a bit disconcerting that when I look at my Buddy list today I still see John Riedl in my list.  The problem is, he’s not  ”Offline,” or “Away,” He’s “Idle!”  So, somewhere out there, or UP there, he’s still logged in and on IM. Of course its on his gtalk account so maybe maybe google is expanding their mission beyond “the world”.  Anyway,  I have this irresistible urge to have a conversation with him.  I hope this imaginary conversation conveys the amazing sense of Humor he always had for whatever we were doing.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3782/10693235065_6670fb784f_o.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Me:  Dude, time to chat?</p>

<p>John:  Just a sec, I’m trying to explain collaborative filtering to the big guy</p>

<p>Me:  I suppose I can wait.</p>

<p>John:  OK, I’m back…. for someone omnipotent, he’s little slow on his basic probability and stats.  He had this cool idea that based on some sins that you had avoided in your past, we might recommend other sins to avoid.
Me:  Wow, we haven’t had a negative rating problem like that since “Cleveland!”  But really rating sins? on a likert scale? do you think that will work?
John:  No, I think this would be a much better app to test out some of our hypotheses on implicit ratings.  Anyway,   What’s up.</p>

<p>Me:  Just missing you.  Remember the first class I had from you? It was Fall 1993, CS8101 &ndash; Distributed Systems.  </p>

<p>John:  Wow, that was a long time ago.</p>

<p>Me:  Remember the project that Dave Truckenmiller and I did?  We designed a Distributed Version Control System, for SCoNes.   </p>

<p>John:  Scones?  </p>

<p>Me:   Devices on a Seldomly Connected Network.</p>

<p>John:  HA!  </p>

<p>Me: And remember our DRIP protocol  (Distributed Replicated Information Pile)</p>

<p>John:  Yeah, that was good project, and you got your A, but I think I should go back and revise your grade down.</p>

<p>Me:  Why?</p>

<p>John:  Well if you think about it,  in the end you guys got it wrong by requiring locking.   I think we had a long talk about merge versus lock.  Clearly the people in the merging camp like git and mercurial got it right in the end.</p>

<p>Me:  Ok, but they did come to the party almost 15 years later!</p>

<p>John:  Fair point, turns out its pretty hard to revise a grade after all these years anyway.
 
Me:  Do you remember the cease and desist letter we got from the Better Business bureau lawyers?</p>

<p>John:  That was great!  Maybe if someone hadn’t photoshopped the BBB torch into some bizarre mashup of a  BNC connector with a computer on the top, and then put it on a website, this never would have happened!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7323/10693236715_2f75194de9_o.jpg" alt="BBB" /></p>

<p>Me:  I think it had more to do with our naming the server the Better Bit Bureau!  I thought I might be the first PhD student to flunk out of the U for copyright infringement.  Plus we only had like 10 users at the time, so really!! Who cared?
John:  You were worried!?  I didn’t even have tenure yet!  I Remember that they told us we could use any one of their ‘B’ words, but not two of the three together.Me:  Yeah, luckily choosing a new name was “just a simple matter of coding”
 
Me:  Remember the ultimate test newsgroup for the Grouplens Usenet trial?
John:  Ha,  how could I forget that?  I know you and Joe were a lot more partial to rec.food.recipes, but you can’t beat alt.sex.grouplens.
Me: Uh John,  You don’t think they are, you know, monitoring your transmissions up there.
John:  Well, I haven’t seen any guys from the NSA wandering around.  Plus, what are they going to do to me?
 </p>

<p>Me:  I worked so hard to get the emacs gnus reader working.   Hours of fun hacking in lisp.
John:  Yeah, I never could understand those people that used vi!  Emacs rules man!
Me:  We worked so hard on that trial, and I had so many hypotheses that were totally wrong.
John:  Yep, but remember I always told you that a negative result is still a result.  And there is nothing more cruel in the world than the murder of a theory by a cold, hard, ugly fact.
Me:  You said it.  I can’t tell you how much comfort I got from that.
 </p>

<p>Me:  Hey, speaking of names do you remember that particularly long afternoon of trying to come up with a company and product name?
John:  How could I forget.  You were the worst!  ”Villagent”  who would buy software from a bunch of Vigalantes!?
Me:  Yeah, that was not one of my finer ideas.  It was cool that GroupLens got to live on through a few product cycles at least.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/10693277824_a9df1562f9_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>John:  I think our  release code names were the best.  - Photuris was my favorite.  
Me:  Yeah the Firefly killer.  We showed those Media Lab guys a thing or two.  But I might have to go with Cleveland, just because it drove Steven crazy.
John:  Cleveland, I remember that!  We even had T-shirts made up for that one.
 </p>

<p> 
Me:  well, I’d like to chat more but they only gave me 3-5 minutes for this tribute.  Just one last question for you.  Why isn’t your status Away?
John:  Thats easy, Brad.  I’m not.  I live on in your memories, I live on through Eric, Karen, and Kevin, and I live on through you and the rest of my students.  Don’t worry, I’ll always be with you in spirit.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Loyal readers will remember that last summer we cruised to Alaska, and some very secretive things were happening on that cruise that I could only refer to rather cryptically.  Well, with the airing of last nights episode of Top Chef the story can now be told.</p>

<p>We were on the set for the filming of the Quickfire challenge onboard the ship!  Although the filming took several hours, we got less than 1 second of screen time.  But here we are!  Brian and I happened to be in a pretty good spot as the camera flashes past us several times.  The ladies we were talking to turned out to be from Wisconsin, in fact from right by our cabin!  The two in the print shirts actually got an additional 2 seconds of screen time along with their comments on the food.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8433342727" title="View 'IMG_0276' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="IMG_0276" alt="IMG_0276" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8354/8433342727_68204d7fdd.jpg" width="500"/></a>

Jane, Brian, and I all made it on again towards the end of the challenge.  Sadly there is no sign of Holly.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8434428742" title="View 'IMG_0277' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="IMG_0277" alt="IMG_0277" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8355/8434428742_32af448c8b.jpg" width="500"/></a>

<p>Of course since this was all way before the show started we had no idea who any of the chefs really were.  I do remember really liking Sheldon&#8217;s lettuce cups as well as Stefan&#8217;s little potato soup cup.  I could swear that I remember seeing Kristin on the ship, so maybe she got to come along since she would be competing in last chance kitchen in Juneau. </p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m looking forward to the finale.  I&#8217;m not sure who I want to win the most, with Stefan and Josie gone all the villains are off the show.  I think it would be awesome if Kristin makes it through LCK and gets to compete against Sheldon or Josh in the Finale.  Thats Josh, by the way, in the first photo.</p>
