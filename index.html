  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we moved south, from Fisherman&rsquo;s wharf down to Menlo Park.  But most of the day was spent at Google.  This was certainly a day that everyone has been looking forward to for most of the trip.</p>

<p>My interest in Google+ was renewed by a great tech talk by Ed Chi.  Who said some very nice things about me in front of my students.  They probably think I paid him.  We heard about supporting an organization as large as Google from Luther Alum Charles Banta, and about i18n &mdash; i(nternationalizatio)n from Luther Alum and former CS faculty member Craig Cornelius.  Yes there are 18 letters between the parenthesis!  We had a fabulous tour of campus, a stop in the 3D printer lab, time at the gift shop, and of course, lunch at Charlie&rsquo;s Cafe.</p>

<p>You have probably heard about Google&rsquo;s famous slides, but they also have fire poles for people that want to quickly get down a floor.  And, in case you don&rsquo;t want to walk between buildings they have these cool Google Bikes all over the place.  Guests are encouraged not to ride the bikes, but nobody said anything about posing with one for your picture.</p>

<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/GoogleBike.jpg" alt="Google Bike" /></p>

<p>The other talk we heard was from Brian, a member of the self driving car project, who gave us a quick overview of the Google X Chauffeur Project.  The technology is interesting, and I have to admit I hadn&rsquo;t really thought past the cool sensors, and modeling that would be required.  But, what is even more interesting are the many social implications of self driving cars.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Ann is on a roll, we are going to be late.&rdquo;  I texted to Phillip.  Indeed she was.  Ann Winblad was the first investor in my Company, Net Perceptions, back in 1996.  She was an investor, a  mentor, and a supporter of us for years.  Today she was giving my students a lesson in the new economics and ecosystems of software development.  <em>I</em> was taking notes as fast as I could to keep up with the stream of new companies and technologies that were <em>must know</em> things according to Ann.</p>

<p>After the lesson she opened up the floor to questions, and the stories began to flow. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following is a republication of a post I wrote for Luther College&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.luther.edu/ideas-creations-blog/">&ldquo;Ideas and Creations&rdquo; Blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Changing the World: Understanding Entrepreneurship, January 2014</h3>

<p>I have never been so glad to leave Minnesota as I was on January 6th.  The temperature outside was -24 with a windchill that defied all logic.  I was headed for Seattle with 11 Luther students to begin my course on &ldquo;Understanding Entrepreneurship.&rdquo;  I really enjoy traveling with students.  Their energy, their enthusiasm, their ability to eat a <em>doughnut burger</em> at the airport before getting on a three hour flight.</p>

<p>Our itinerary for the three-week course includes four days in Seattle, an overnight train ride, six days in San Francisco, four days in Silicon Valley, a continuation of the train ride to Las Angeles where we will conclude the trip. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Curiosity is the cure for boredom.  There is no cure for curiosity.  We began our day with a visit to PR firm, Schwartz MSL, Bryan Scanlon gave the group a great overview of the players in the PR space and how PR companies work.   The tagline for their group may be something like &ldquo;telling stories that matter.&rdquo; I like this and it resonates well with a lot of the career advice people are sharing with the students.</p>

<p>In fact Bryan told a great story about his brother that really helped emphasize the message that you have to find a real world outlet for your skills and then use your skills to develop something real, something that you can tell a story about. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a great day for a bike ride!  We rented some bikes at Blazing Saddles, right next to the hotel.  Then took off for the golden gate bridge.  It was a beautiful day and no surprise, the bike paths were very crowded with all kinds of people enjoying the outdoors and the scenery.</p>

<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/GoldenBike1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>About half of the group above rode across the bridge and back.  Here is me leading the pack.</p>

<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/GoldenBike2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The other half followed me further on into Sausalito, with the goal of making it to Muir Woods.  The second half of the trek started off very nicely with a long downhill.  which was quickly followed by a steep uphill.  All well and good until my riders started to figure out that &ldquo;what goes down must be climbed back up!&rdquo;  The ride flattened out through Sausalito and beyond so it was a nice easy ride for a while.  But it was getting to noon, and we&rsquo;d already ridden about 12 miles.  I misunderstood the directions from the bike shop and thought we had about 12 more to go.  So, since the guys all had tickets to Alcatraz and had to be ready to board by about 3:30 we decided to turn back short of our goal.  It turns out we were much closer and could have made it to the redwoods!  Bummer.</p>

<p>In any case, we rode just over 25 miles, and it sure felt good to be on a bike outside again!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A 23 hour train trip?  At some point that seemed like a really charming idea.  Eight hours in, I&rsquo;ll say that the bloom is off the rose.  Its been a nice ride, and a good chance to catch up on some reading and blogging but for the most part its just a long ride on a train full of people.  The views have been OK, but it is now dark outside.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What?  There is no real way to know the answer to this question, but it is one that was posed to the group today.  How do you handle uncertainty?  How do well do you think on your feet?  This is a typical interview question used by many high tech companies.  At Luther we might ask prospective faculty, &ldquo;how many cornstalks in the state of Iowa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question definitely stumped a few people in the room, but others got the idea quickly. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Bezos likes to talk about technology and civilization and where we are at in terms of the analogy that we are still at &ldquo;Day One.&rdquo;  He recently observed that we are so early in Day One that the alarm clock hasn&rsquo;t even gone off yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>With new technologies, it’s very tempting to think that you’re further along than you are. But usually, you’re more primitive than you think. My guess is we’re still pretty primitive. We as a society, as a civilization. I doubt we have figured out the new technologies very well yet. At Amazon, we’re doing our part in trying to push things forward, but I have the feeling it’s Day One.</p></blockquote>

<p>And so it was that we found ourselves in the building called Day One South, meeting with our very gracious host Sam. This was a great way to start, and although Sam had not been prompted in any way about what to say, he hit on some of key themes for the students to take away from the course:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Passion</strong> &mdash; You are going to work long hours, so you want to find a place to work and a job to do at that place where you are passionate about whatever it is.  If you aren&rsquo;t excited about it, keep looking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Culture</strong> &mdash; This part of the discussion brought back both great memories and ulcers in my stomach from the days when Amazon was a Net Perceptions customer.  I&rsquo;ve never been pushed harder than I was by Jennifer Jacobi (JJ) when she was my primary contact at Amazon.  She challenged us, held our feet to the fire, threatened to dump us, and ultimately helped us create a better product.  Apparently this is how Amazon treats all its suppliers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk</strong> &mdash; High tech companies are full of risk takers.  Sam was no exception as a young graduate who simply moved to Seattle in search of a job.  Years later he is still at Amazon.  Many more years later than he expected.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/Amazon.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After our meeting with Amazon we found a coffee shop where we could take over a large table and had some group discussion.  I told my own story of Net Perceptions, which I should probably write down here soon, and tried to relate my own experience with the themes I want the students to look for over the next three weeks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was a big day.  The Microsoft mother ship.</p>

<p>We began our visit with an hour in the Envisioning Center, this is Microsoft&rsquo;s take on the future, 5 years out.  There was some pretty cool stuff in there.  If you&rsquo;ve ever drooled over the fancy table on Hawaii Five-O where they can flick things from phone to table, table to screen, etc. You have a pretty good idea of where Microsoft thinks the workplace of the future is headed.  I&rsquo;m there, I want it.  I&rsquo;m already imagining myself walking into the classroom, iPad in hand, and flicking a copy of where we left off last class from my iPad to the board.  Wait, thats a bit of a mixed vision, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they were surface pads, not iPads.  But you get the idea.</p>

<p>After the Envisioning center we moved to another of the 128 buildings on the Microsoft campus where we had time to have our daily group meeting and book presentation.  We were escorted by Tina Wang, and she joined in to the discussion of Sara Lacy&rsquo;s Once you&rsquo;re Lucky, Twice you&rsquo;re good.  Tina works as part of Enwe&rsquo;s group, but is the only one here in the US.  After our lunch we had a really fun talk with Neil Leslie, who shared a lot of wisdom with the group.  And finally Dave Maltz joined us for a final hour on scaling up the data center.  Its fair to say that by the time Dave was done everyone had soaked up about as much information as is possible for brain to take in one day.</p>

<p>A couple observations.  This is not the Microsoft of the 90&rsquo;s.  The Microsoft that I knew and worked with at Net Perceptions were, well, to be blunt, they were bullies back then, because they could be.  I get a real sense that is gone.  Instead they talk of change, how they need to compete, and if you&rsquo;re comfortable, you shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>

<p>Returning to key themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passion:  I don&rsquo;t think I need to say more about this.</li>
<li>Projects:  I&rsquo;ve told my seniors this for a few years now, but it has a lot more credibility coming from an outsider.  You need to have a project to show when you go to interview.  Bring an app you have built on your phone.  Show a website you have developed on the browser.  Be prepared to talk about the challenges, trade-offs, and succeesses you have had in developing your project.</li>
<li>Linked In:  This is a critical tool for finding a job.  If you are a CS junior or senior and have not created a LinkedIn profile.  Do it now.</li>
<li>Failure:  We heard a lot of stories about failure today, and we will continue to hear of them.  Startups, started and &lsquo;buried,&rsquo; products and projects that failed and never saw the light of day.  The most important message, that I hope students get from this trip, and talking to a bunch of successful people, is that failure is OK.  <strong>Fail Fast</strong>, and learn from your mistakes.  It is a cliche to say that you learn more from failure than success, but it is true.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the evening it was fun to unwind with our first group dinner.  We met up with recent Luther Alum Jake Nowosatka at Cutters Crabhouse.  Its at the far end of Pike Place Market.</p>
