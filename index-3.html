    <p>One week after watching our Decorah Vikings take third in the state soccer tournament we were back watching futbol again.  This time we were in Edinburgh Scotland watching USA play England.  Now before you get too worried about us cheering for our side on the home turf of our opponent let me just clarify that when England is playing the Scottish will cheer very loudly for the other team!  As soon as we arrived in Edinburgh Josh. Changed into his USA jersey, and as we were waking around Edinburgh he got lots of comments from the locals.  "nice top there son"  <br><br>So it came to pass that we found ourselves in a hotel bar with lots of support for USA.  On one side was a group of about 20 younger scottish men, and on the other were some additional tourists like ourselves.  We had hoped to experience the game in a pub, but unfortunately they do not allow minors after 8pm.  It was great fun to watch the game here, but I must say that I have grown used to the expert commentary of my friend Jim, who is leading a group of Luther alumni on a trip through Germany at the moment.  I am sure Jim found a good place to watch the game there with some German support.  You see all kinds of people when you watch the game in a hotel bar.  At one point an Asian man came in, and stared at the screen for a couple of minutes before asking "what half is it?". One of our scottish compatriots replied, well I don't know where you're from mate but when the clock says forty two minutes here you're in the first half.  It sounds even funnier when you hear it with the accent.  Needless to say that particular fan did not stick around to watch much of the game.<br><br>When the Americans scored (yes it was an error on the English keeper) the whole bar erupted in cheers and then a chant of USA USA started up.  The bar manager looked like he couldn't decide what to do.  He clearly wanted to  calm everyone down and was obviously worried that a riot was going to break out in his bar.   But he had no idea how what the right strategy was.  In the end order was restored by some humor.  After the cheers erupted and the chant had started one of the scottish fans came running back into the room to see what all of the commotion was about.  As he had been in the toilet, he made a great show of zipping up his zipper which put everyone to laughing, including the manager.  Although I was disappointed to settle for the draw, I think it is a good result for the American side. <br><br>Earlier in the day we did spend some time walking around Edinburgh, we walked the Royal Mile, and checked out Holyrood House.  We have now seen all the royal residences except for Balmoral.  The big story of Holyrood is that this is where Mary Queen of Scots spent a lot of time, and it is also where her young son was killed right before her eyes by her husband.  Nice guy, who wanted the throne bad enough to kill his stepson.  Here is a picture of the Abbey.<br><br><br></p>

    <p>I am writing this on the train from London to Edinburgh where they have just announced the breakfast options.  I don't get the concept of "English breakfast."  I would like to meet the chef who came up with the idea of serving baked beans and eggs together!  My guess is that if I did meet him I would learn that he was also the inventor of the "Pudding Menu."  At every hotel the included breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, and baked beans. I don't like baked beans under the best of conditions, and certainly not first thing in the morning.  I guess it must be one of those things you need to grow up with in order to appreciate.  In the meantime I will just stick to having tea.<br><br><br>Anyway, now that I have addressed the breakfast issue I will praise the train system.  This is really a the way to travel.  We have four seats facing each other in coach, tons of legroom, a table in between us, great scenery, free wifi, and a very quiet ride.  No long hassles of getting to the station 90 minutes ahead of time, and no long security lines.  Just walk to the platform, get on your train, stow your luggage and take a seat.  As we reevaluate travel the US I really wonder what it would take to get this kind of convenience.  I, for one would travel this way whenever possible.<br><br>I also want to say how much I love traveling with my iPad!  This thing is great.  It's small, light, the battery life is awesome, I have a bunch of books to read on it, a couple of movies to watch, the current season of Merlin, and games to entertain me when I am tired of all of the above. Other than if I really needed to write a program I can not imagine why I would ever need to travel with a laptop.  In fact I think this is really the start of something new.  I don't see myself needing a laptop.  My setup would be a nice big desktop machine for programming and writing in LaTeX, and my iPad for the times I am not at my desk.<br><br>Finally, as long as I'm rambling on about products and travel I have to say that I love my ScotteVest. (www.scottevest.com).  Its a vest designed for travel, that includes zip pockets for just about everything.  I can carry camera lenses, glasses, iPod, phone, and all kinds of things.  I think it has 20 pockets in total, so there is a pocket for just about everything.  It keeps me warm at the temperatures we are traveling in at the moment, and with all the zippers and inner pockets I feel pretty secure.<br><br>- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<br><br></p>

    <p>Since I already posted about today's adventures I guess this is a catchup posting about yesterday.  We started our day with a quick trip in to Oxford.  We drove around the University area, and found the varsity shop so we could get the requisite sweatshirts.  We also found a Starbucks for a quick breakfast.<br><br>From Oxford we headed to Windsor Castle.  Nothing can prepare you for the first view of Windsor from the distance.  It is the most imposing, amazing castle you have ever seen.  Josh and I said that if we were an invading army and saw that castle from a distance we would simply turn our horses around and ride home.  "Run away, Run away..." in your best Monty Python voice. It just looks like every castle you have ever imagined.  Here's josh standing below one of the towers.<br><br><br><br></p>
<center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/1063.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/s_1063.jpg" border="0" width="187" height="281" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br>The tour of the inside of the castle included the living quarters, as well as St. Georges Chapel.  St. Georges is where the Queen knights the new Knights. The living quarters were, of course, amazing, and large, but the scale on the inside just did not compare to the outside view.<br><br>After Windsor we returned our car to Hertz and then we were supposed to meet a car we had pre-arranged with Simply Airports.  After waiting 15 minutes we called.  Yes, the driver is there, in a blue Chrysler, he is looking for you.  Can he call you on this cell phone number?  Of course, but no call.  Another 15 minutes and we determined that although the driver had not been able to call us on our european cell phone, he was at the wrong Hertz.  He was at the airport counter not at their drop off location near the airport.  He'll be right there.  Oh wait, where is it?  How does he get there?  How does he get here?  Dude, follow the signs to rental car return and come on in to Hertz.   15 minutes later still no sign of the driver.  Time for "Plan B"  We hop on the Hertz shuttle to head back to the airport and take the train to downtown.  As we leave Hertz we see a Blue Chrysler mini-van making a u-turn and heading back down the road the wrong way.  Really?  Was this guy actually waiting for us to come out the Hertz exit rather than driving in?  I guess we'll never know.  But in the meantime, I would not recommend booking a car with Simply Airports.<br><br>By the time we got to our hotel, we were all tired, hungry, and a little bit grumpy, but we decided to press on.  We walked back up to Victoria Station,  Then to BUCKingham Palace, through the park, on to Trafalger Square, and finally to Parliament.  The parliament building is also massive and old.  Mike if you are reading here's some Timber frame porn for you:<br><br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/1064.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/11/s_1064.jpg" border="0" width="187" height="281" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br><br>This hall was probably two football fields long!  Look at all of that English Oak!  We were also able to see the house of commons in session.  We saw several ministers arguing about poverty in great britain, along with several people in traditional wigs.<br><br>We completed our day by finishing our circle tour, walking back toward Victoria Station.  We decided to have dinner at L'Arco Italian restaurant, right around the corner from the theater where Billy Elliot is playing.  It was a small family run establishment, and the food was really good.  I had a tomato based Risotto and some Veal Marsala.  Jane had the Risotto too, Kaia had some delicious pesto gnocchi, and josh pizza marguerita of course.<br><br><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-629658427605568001?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com" alt=""></div>

    <p>Today's travel adventure involved the Tower of London.  No, we were not arrested and tortured by the English royalty.  We were on a tour of the tower of london.  We had just finished the guided tour with one of the Yoman Warders (cool title eh?) and we decided to go in and check out the Armoury. (yep I'm converting to british spelling)  Just after we got in the door an alarm started to go off, and a woman steward came hurrying buy and told us that we had to evacuate the tower.  We were never able to to find out why we had to evacuate but Jane overheard a couple of them talking about a fire alarm.  The tower of London is also the site where Henry VIII beheaded several of his wives, including Anne Boleyn.<br><br>We started our day by taking the tube to St. Paul's Cathedral.  After walking around the sanctuary we resumed our european stair climbing tradition.  We first walked 257 stairs to the whispering gallery.  This is a cool balcony where you can face the wall and whisper.  The person standing directly opposite you across the circle, over 100 feet away, can hear you perfectly clearly.  I'd like to explain the physics of this but I'm told that my readership will decline if I include any equations.  I guess all three of you are safe and will remain loyal readers.  After the whispering gallery we continued another 266 stairs up to the gold gallery.  From here we had a very good, but slightly foggy view of all of London.  <br><br>Next we walked across the Millennium bridge and toured Shakespeare's Globe theater.  This is a slightly modernized version of the original, but still true to the spirit of performing plays in daylight where the actors and audience are face to face.  It would have been really fun to try to watch a show there, but Macbeth is being performed at the moment and it seemed a bit dark, and long given our schedule for the day.<br><br>Now we are chilling at our hotel, the Luna Simone, watching Mexico and South Africa play futbol.  South Africa just scored and are up one nil.  Very exciting for the South African side.  We have been researching whether or not we dare show the american colors during the game tomorrow.  Research has indicated that the scottish people will cheer for ANY opponent of England, so we feel pretty comfortable about watching the game in a pub in Ediburgh tomorrow.  Maybe some nice scottish people will buy us a pint if we win!   (darn, Mexico just scored)<br><br>Kaia is waiting patiently for her phone call from her Concordia advisor to do her registration!  Then we'll grab a quick dinner and head out to see Billy Elliot at the Victoria Palace Theater.  We had three shows that we wanted to see while we were in London and this one won out since we walked right by the box office last night.  We also wanted to see Stomp, and We Will Rock You. Yes, a Queen musical, featuring Bohemian Rhapsody and of course We Will Rock You.<br> <br></p>

    <p>Do you remember Sir John Gielgud  from the movie Arthur? Jeeves maybe? Imagine the most proper british gentleman you can, and you will have our guide for the tour of Blenheim Palace we had today.  This guy was much shorter than Sir Gielgud but he was a pretty good guide.  He told us about fine china and tapestries the architects of the Palace along with many of the priceless artifacts that have been collected by the Spencer Churchill family over the years.  As we finished each room of the palace our guide would say very politely, well if there are no questions I think that just covers it.<br><br>After our tour with Jeeves, we decided to see the Untold Story of Blenheim.  This is part Disney animatronics and part history lesson.  All in all it did not work for us.  The animated dummies they had playing the parts of members of the royal households were all placed in front of 'mirrors' which were really computer screens, so although we looked at the dummy's back we saw a real person's face projected on the screen as if it was a reflection.  These characters tried to tell us the back story behind how the Palace was constructed.  One can only take so much royal sex scandal before it gets old.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

<br><br>Blenheim Palace is the home of the family of the Duke of Marlborough, although once a year they have to send a flag to BUCKingham, yes you must say that with a British accent with all of the emphasis on the BUCK and you will have it just about right.  The purpose of the flags is to avoid paying what must be an incredible amount of rent.  As long as the flag is delivered on time the family gets another year rent free.<br><br>Blenheim was actually our second castle of the day today.  We started the morning by visiting Sudeley castle in the Cotswolds.  This is one of the castles where Henry VIII and his wives hung out.  Much of the castle is in ruins now, but it really is interesting, especially after watching several episodes of The Tudors on HBO.  Other highlights of Sudeley were the Gardens and the Peacocks that were running around and in captivity in the Pheasantry.  Yes, how many of  you have been to a Pheasantry??<br><br><br><br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/1493.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/s_1493.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="187" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br><br>Lunch today was at Noel Arms in Chipping Camden.  Jane had a Ploughman's lunch, Josh had ice cream, and Kaia and I tried a burger.  It was a nice English pub and we had to try some of the local brews, also quite good.<br><br>We stayed in Woodstock at The Bear, It is a hotel in a building that was built in the late 1600's!  The rooms are everywhere with no two alike.  While Kaia went for a run I had a real english G&amp;T although I really did not appreciate the use of the slice of cucumber in place of the lime.  Dinner was at a small family run italian restaurant (Branca) across the street from the hotel.  I had a great bolognese, Jane had Arrabiata, and Josh and Kaia had Pizza.  All in all this was a great birthday!<br><br><p class="blogpress_location">Location:<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Woodstock,%20England&amp;z=10">Woodstock, England</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday we flew from Chicago to London.  We tried a day flight instead of an overnight flight and it worked very well.  We left Chicago at 9:05AM and arrived at Heathrow at 10:30PM.  The flight was very easy an non-eventful, it worked perfect for someone who cannot fall asleep on an airplane.  We got into Heathrow and did the customs thing and by the time we got to our hotel it was after midnight.  To our bodies it was still early evening but by 1:30 we all had lights out and were working on sleep.<br><br>We did sleep in until 8:45 this morning.  From there we took off for Bath by way of Stonehenge.  For those of you who don't know, Stonehenge is a big circle of rocks.  Merlin the magician moved them down from Ireland sometime in the distant past.  This was well before King Uther died, because he is apparently buried in Stonehenge.  Here's Kaia and Josh at Stonehenge.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
<center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1857.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1857.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="187" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br><br>At lunchtime we at at a local establishment called Jacqueline's Bistro.  Jane and Kaia had fresh baked baguettes with goat cheese, Josh had a ham and cheese omelet with salad and I had fish and chips.<br><br>From there we moved on to our final destination for today, Bath.  When you arrive in downtown Bath you are "in a twisty turny maze"  Its hard to know where you are, and the gps was equally unenlightened at several points.  When we finally did find the parking lot where we were supposed to leave our car, it was closed for re-surfacing!  So we had to go back to find a different lot that we had passed along the way.<br><br>After parking the car it was a very short walk to our Bed &amp; Breakfast at Three Abbey Green. We have a beautiful two room suite, so we have to room to spread out tonight.  Josh and Kaia both have their own beds and Kaia gets a separate bedroom.  Breakfast is included as part of the deal in the morning.  Here's a nice view of the courtyard and our place for the night.  The entrance is to the left of the giant tree in this photo:<br><br><br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1858.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1858.jpg" border="0" width="187" height="281" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br><br>We went out to view the sites of Bath, its a great downtown area once you are on foot.  We visited the Roman Baths - from whence Bath got its name  - and looked at the Abbey.  Went shopping to replace the shorts that I left hanging on the back of the bathroom door at the Super 8 in Chicago.  On the recommendation of our hotelier we went to the Eye of India for some great Indian food for dinner.  We had Tikki Takka Tak, (I'm not making that up) Garlic Chili Masala, and Chicken Khorma, along with rice and nan.  Here's Kaia and Jane at the Baths.<br><br><br><br><center><a href="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1859.jpg"><img src="http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1859.jpg" border="0" width="281" height="187" style="margin:5px"></a></center>
<br><br>The highlight of the day was definitely the after dinner show, called Bazaar Bath.  Its a comedy/magic show that roams around downtown.  The host entertains by poking fun of the people on the tour and doing tricks.  As advertised, you do not learn anything about the history or culture of Bath, but it is a lot of laughs and I highly recommend this show if you come to Bath.<br><br>Unfortunately our string of injuries continues  as Jane seems to have slipped a disc as we were walking around for the show tonight.  Hopefully ibuprofen and heat will have her back as good as new in the morning.<br><br><p class="blogpress_location">Location:<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bath,%20England&amp;z=10">Bath, England</a></p>

    <p>Sitting in the Super 8 in Elk Grove IL, our plane leaves at 9:05 tomorrow morning.  This is a new experiment for us, as usually flights to europe are overnight flights.  This one will put us in London at 10:45 PM.  We are hopeful that this will alleviate the jet lag on the first day.  Time will tell.<br><br>Not much else to report today except that I put a big gash in the top of my head before we even left the house today.  I was out scooping poop in the back yard so Josh could mow before we left.  As I was walking up the yard focusing on scanning the ground ahead of me I ran smack into a low hanging branch of the Oak tree.  I immediately put my hand to my head and it came away full of blood.  Head wounds really do bleed a lot.  After determining I would not need stitches Jane put some neosporin on the cut and that was that.  My scalp itches and my head still hurts a bit.  I think cutting off that limb will be a high priority project when we get back home.<br><br>We drove to chicago by way of Madison and stopped to have supper with Holly and Madeline at the Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant.  I had the caribbean jerk sauce which I thought was quite good.  Not anywhere near as spicy as my burrito from Panchero's yesterday.  If you guys at Panchero's down in Ankeney are reading this, I would just say you do not need to use a whole scoop of your hottest sauce in your burrito, particularly since you have become so stingy with your sour cream.  This is the first thing in my life that I have not been able to eat because it was too spicy.  I might also just add that this extreme amount of heat was not just my own tender palate, but was confirmed by He-man Joel Martin, who reportedly lives off Panchero's at law school.  He had thoughtfully offered to finish my burrito for me, but was similarly stymied by the extreme heat.  All of this just serves to remind me that I am looking forward to some good Indian food once we get to England.<br><br><br><br>- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<br></p>

    <p>The second 'Understanding Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley' started this week.  Yesterday was our first full day of meetings.<br><br>We started out with Steve Larson at <a href="http://www.callspark.com">Callspark</a>.  Then had lunch at <a href="http://www.suriyasrestaurant.com">Suriya Thai</a> with Alison Johnston from <a href="http://www.vark.com">Aardvark</a>, beers with Matt Van Horn at <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>, and a great experience at <a href="posts/2010/01/www.sfnewtech.com">sfnewtech</a>.<br><br></p>
<p>Here's the gang at Lunch.  It was fun, everyone was trying new stuff that was a little out of the comfort zone for a bunch of midwesterners.</p>

<br><br><p>The words of the day are "stalking" and "audacious."  This seemed to be a theme from many people in terms of both job hiring and job seeking.</p>
