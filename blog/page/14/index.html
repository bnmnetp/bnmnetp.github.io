  <div class="entry-content">Today&#8217;s travel adventure involved the Tower of London.  No, we were not arrested and tortured by the English royalty.  We were on a tour of the tower of london.  We had just finished the guided tour with one of the Yoman Warders (cool title eh?) and we decided to go in and check out the Armoury. (yep I&#8217;m converting to british spelling)  Just after we got in the door an alarm started to go off, and a woman steward came hurrying buy and told us that we had to evacuate the tower.  We were never able to to find out why we had to evacuate but Jane overheard a couple of them talking about a fire alarm.  The tower of London is also the site where Henry VIII beheaded several of his wives, including Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />We started our day by taking the tube to St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral.  After walking around the sanctuary we resumed our european stair climbing tradition.  We first walked 257 stairs to the whispering gallery.  This is a cool balcony where you can face the wall and whisper.  The person standing directly opposite you across the circle, over 100 feet away, can hear you perfectly clearly.  I&#8217;d like to explain the physics of this but I&#8217;m told that my readership will decline if I include any equations.  I guess all three of you are safe and will remain loyal readers.  After the whispering gallery we continued another 266 stairs up to the gold gallery.  From here we had a very good, but slightly foggy view of all of London.  <br /><br />Next we walked across the Millennium bridge and toured Shakespeare&#8217;s Globe theater.  This is a slightly modernized version of the original, but still true to the spirit of performing plays in daylight where the actors and audience are face to face.  It would have been really fun to try to watch a show there, but Macbeth is being performed at the moment and it seemed a bit dark, and long given our schedule for the day.<br /><br />Now we are chilling at our hotel, the Luna Simone, watching Mexico and South Africa play futbol.  South Africa just scored and are up one nil.  Very exciting for the South African side.  We have been researching whether or not we dare show the american colors during the game tomorrow.  Research has indicated that the scottish people will cheer for ANY opponent of England, so we feel pretty comfortable about watching the game in a pub in Ediburgh tomorrow.  Maybe some nice scottish people will buy us a pint if we win!   (darn, Mexico just scored)<br /><br />Kaia is waiting patiently for her phone call from her Concordia advisor to do her registration!  Then we&#8217;ll grab a quick dinner and head out to see Billy Elliot at the Victoria Palace Theater.  We had three shows that we wanted to see while we were in London and this one won out since we walked right by the box office last night.  We also wanted to see Stomp, and We Will Rock You. Yes, a Queen musical, featuring Bohemian Rhapsody and of course We Will Rock You.<br /> <br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=London,%20England&z=10'>London, England</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3408176807179586741?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Do you remember Sir John Gielgud  from the movie Arthur? Jeeves maybe? Imagine the most proper british gentleman you can, and you will have our guide for the tour of Blenheim Palace we had today.  This guy was much shorter than Sir Gielgud but he was a pretty good guide.  He told us about fine china and tapestries the architects of the Palace along with many of the priceless artifacts that have been collected by the Spencer Churchill family over the years.  As we finished each room of the palace our guide would say very politely, well if there are no questions I think that just covers it.<br /><br />After our tour with Jeeves, we decided to see the Untold Story of Blenheim.  This is part Disney animatronics and part history lesson.  All in all it did not work for us.  The animated dummies they had playing the parts of members of the royal households were all placed in front of &#8216;mirrors&#8217; which were really computer screens, so although we looked at the dummy&#8217;s back we saw a real person&#8217;s face projected on the screen as if it was a reflection.  These characters tried to tell us the back story behind how the Palace was constructed.  One can only take so much royal sex scandal before it gets old.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/1492.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/s_1492.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />Blenheim Palace is the home of the family of the Duke of Marlborough, although once a year they have to send a flag to BUCKingham, yes you must say that with a British accent with all of the emphasis on the BUCK and you will have it just about right.  The purpose of the flags is to avoid paying what must be an incredible amount of rent.  As long as the flag is delivered on time the family gets another year rent free.<br /><br />Blenheim was actually our second castle of the day today.  We started the morning by visiting Sudeley castle in the Cotswolds.  This is one of the castles where Henry VIII and his wives hung out.  Much of the castle is in ruins now, but it really is interesting, especially after watching several episodes of The Tudors on HBO.  Other highlights of Sudeley were the Gardens and the Peacocks that were running around and in captivity in the Pheasantry.  Yes, how many of  you have been to a Pheasantry??<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/1493.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/10/s_1493.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />Lunch today was at Noel Arms in Chipping Camden.  Jane had a Ploughman&#8217;s lunch, Josh had ice cream, and Kaia and I tried a burger.  It was a nice English pub and we had to try some of the local brews, also quite good.<br /><br />We stayed in Woodstock at The Bear, It is a hotel in a building that was built in the late 1600&#8217;s!  The rooms are everywhere with no two alike.  While Kaia went for a run I had a real english G&T although I really did not appreciate the use of the slice of cucumber in place of the lime.  Dinner was at a small family run italian restaurant (Branca) across the street from the hotel.  I had a great bolognese, Jane had Arrabiata, and Josh and Kaia had Pizza.  All in all this was a great birthday!<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Woodstock,%20England&z=10'>Woodstock, England</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-554403121483725046?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Sitting in the Super 8 in Elk Grove IL, our plane leaves at 9:05 tomorrow morning.  This is a new experiment for us, as usually flights to europe are overnight flights.  This one will put us in London at 10:45 PM.  We are hopeful that this will alleviate the jet lag on the first day.  Time will tell.<br /><br />Not much else to report today except that I put a big gash in the top of my head before we even left the house today.  I was out scooping poop in the back yard so Josh could mow before we left.  As I was walking up the yard focusing on scanning the ground ahead of me I ran smack into a low hanging branch of the Oak tree.  I immediately put my hand to my head and it came away full of blood.  Head wounds really do bleed a lot.  After determining I would not need stitches Jane put some neosporin on the cut and that was that.  My scalp itches and my head still hurts a bit.  I think cutting off that limb will be a high priority project when we get back home.<br /><br />We drove to chicago by way of Madison and stopped to have supper with Holly and Madeline at the Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant.  I had the caribbean jerk sauce which I thought was quite good.  Not anywhere near as spicy as my burrito from Panchero&#8217;s yesterday.  If you guys at Panchero&#8217;s down in Ankeney are reading this, I would just say you do not need to use a whole scoop of your hottest sauce in your burrito, particularly since you have become so stingy with your sour cream.  This is the first thing in my life that I have not been able to eat because it was too spicy.  I might also just add that this extreme amount of heat was not just my own tender palate, but was confirmed by He-man Joel Martin, who reportedly lives off Panchero&#8217;s at law school.  He had thoughtfully offered to finish my burrito for me, but was similarly stymied by the extreme heat.  All of this just serves to remind me that I am looking forward to some good Indian food once we get to England.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6941766327029827348?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Yesterday we flew from Chicago to London.  We tried a day flight instead of an overnight flight and it worked very well.  We left Chicago at 9:05AM and arrived at Heathrow at 10:30PM.  The flight was very easy an non-eventful, it worked perfect for someone who cannot fall asleep on an airplane.  We got into Heathrow and did the customs thing and by the time we got to our hotel it was after midnight.  To our bodies it was still early evening but by 1:30 we all had lights out and were working on sleep.<br /><br />We did sleep in until 8:45 this morning.  From there we took off for Bath by way of Stonehenge.  For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Stonehenge is a big circle of rocks.  Merlin the magician moved them down from Ireland sometime in the distant past.  This was well before King Uther died, because he is apparently buried in Stonehenge.  Here&#8217;s Kaia and Josh at Stonehenge.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1857.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1857.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />At lunchtime we at at a local establishment called Jacqueline&#8217;s Bistro.  Jane and Kaia had fresh baked baguettes with goat cheese, Josh had a ham and cheese omelet with salad and I had fish and chips.<br /><br />From there we moved on to our final destination for today, Bath.  When you arrive in downtown Bath you are &#8220;in a twisty turny maze&#8221;  Its hard to know where you are, and the gps was equally unenlightened at several points.  When we finally did find the parking lot where we were supposed to leave our car, it was closed for re-surfacing!  So we had to go back to find a different lot that we had passed along the way.<br /><br />After parking the car it was a very short walk to our Bed & Breakfast at Three Abbey Green. We have a beautiful two room suite, so we have to room to spread out tonight.  Josh and Kaia both have their own beds and Kaia gets a separate bedroom.  Breakfast is included as part of the deal in the morning.  Here&#8217;s a nice view of the courtyard and our place for the night.  The entrance is to the left of the giant tree in this photo:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1858.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1858.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />We went out to view the sites of Bath, its a great downtown area once you are on foot.  We visited the Roman Baths - from whence Bath got its name  - and looked at the Abbey.  Went shopping to replace the shorts that I left hanging on the back of the bathroom door at the Super 8 in Chicago.  On the recommendation of our hotelier we went to the Eye of India for some great Indian food for dinner.  We had Tikki Takka Tak, (I&#8217;m not making that up) Garlic Chili Masala, and Chicken Khorma, along with rice and nan.  Here&#8217;s Kaia and Jane at the Baths.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1859.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1859.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />The highlight of the day was definitely the after dinner show, called Bazaar Bath.  Its a comedy/magic show that roams around downtown.  The host entertains by poking fun of the people on the tour and doing tricks.  As advertised, you do not learn anything about the history or culture of Bath, but it is a lot of laughs and I highly recommend this show if you come to Bath.<br /><br />Unfortunately our string of injuries continues  as Jane seems to have slipped a disc as we were walking around for the show tonight.  Hopefully ibuprofen and heat will have her back as good as new in the morning.<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bath,%20England&z=10'>Bath, England</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8985996883290673845?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">After spending a ton of money in town, what could be better than a great meal on the ship.  One of the activities that Jane had researched before the cruise is called the Chef&#8217;s table.  This is a really exclusive experience that they only do once a cruise for a very limited number of people.  In our case there were ten of us lucky passengers that called toget our name on the list as soon as we got on the ship.  Of the ten all of us were experienced multi-cruise passengers.  A couple of Florida cruises 3 times a year.  Another couple from Ohio had cruised many times with their family.  They were a bit older than us as their kids were out of college by now.  The two other couples were both gay men.  Ha, no stereotypes here that a foodie event should have four gay men in attendance!  One couple was from LA and the other from New York. <br /><br />We all met at the International cafe for a short pre-dinner briefing.  We met the Executive Chef who was our tour guide for the galley and the rest of the evening.  The chef directs a staff of around 250 spread throughout seven galleys on the ship.  We began our tour of the galley that served our dining room by putting on our white FDA inspector lab coats.  As the tour was happening during dinner service we had to wash our hands wear the lab coats. <br /><br />The chef was really friendly and very willing to answer any of our questions.  We told him how much we liked the parmesan crust under the fettucine alfredo and he launched into a very detailed explanation of how they made the crusts each day.  I got the whole thing on video with our little video toy.  <br /><br />At the end of the galley tour we gathered in an out of the way corner and had hors-de-ouveres and champagne.  We started out with a sashimi tuna with wasabi sauce, served on a little scoop made of a fennel root.  This was followed by:  a delicious pate, vegetarian quiche, Escargot, and caviar served on a little potato pancake.  Yes I ate everything including the caviar which was really very good served on the potato pancake with a little sour cream.  As he introduced each appetizer we got a summary of how it was prepared.  It was really interesting.  None of the appetizers or anything in our meal is available anywhere else on the ship.  It is a meal that is totally unique to the Chefs Table dinner.<br /><br />After the appetizers we made our way through the dining room to a special table.  As we walked through the dining room everyone applauded the chef and many applauded us as well having no idea that we were just on a special tour!<br /><br />While we were in the kitchen we were promised a lobster risotto and some &#8220;special surprises&#8221;  We began with another little appetizer and some Pouilly Fume.  The latest appetizer was beef carpacio on foccacia.  The carpacio was layered with alternating layers of parmesan cheese and arugula.  It was good but too much considering everything else we knew was coming.   Next was the Lobster Risotto.  This was probably the best Risotto I&#8217;ve ever had in a restaurant.  (except maybe that one exceptional night at LaRanna where I had the Asiago cheese risotto with cauliflower)<br /><br />By now of course our pallets were in real need of cleansing.  So the maitre de brought out a round of lemon sorbet.  Of course sorbet alone would not work as well as sorbet with Grey Goose vodka poured over the top.<br /><br />With clean pallets we finally moved to the main course.  Potatos gratin with lobster, veal, and tornados of beef.  Plus some veggies thrown in for good measure.  I can only describe this course as a cruise size portion.  Each person had their own platter full of meat, potatos and veggies.  Everything was just great.  At this point we switched to a Wolf-Blass Shiraz to accompany the main course.<br /><br />After the main course was done we moved on to the cheese course.  Roquefort balls and a bridge of parmesan cheese.  This was not my favorite course as the roquefort was really strong, and the parmesan bridge was &#8216;more &#8216;structural than edilble&#8217; in the words of one of our dinner companions.<br /><br />The next course was the true dessert course, presented by the ships pastry chef.  He had constructed a really nice Amaretto desert plate for us which was really a sculpture on a plate.   Desert was served with a delicious desert wine.<br /><br />Next we had our espresso or capucino served with some home made chocolates.<br /><br />The grand finale was nice glass of limoncello.<br /><br />After the meal was over the maitre de and photographer showed up.  Each couple got their picture taken with the chef and staff, and each &#8216;lady&#8217; recieved a cookbook.  Notably the gay couples did not receive any cookbooks!  This was rectified after one of the guys took the maitre de aside and explained that it probably wasn&#8217;t fair for them to be excluded from the cookbook.  Since they paid the same as us and probably cooked just as much as the rest of us.  One of the guys was a professor at Loyala Marymount in LA and he and I talked a little college shop during the dinner.<br /><br />When one of the other guys found out I was leading a J-term trip to Silicon Valley during January he volunteered to connect me with a friend of his that works at Pixar!  Wow that would be an awesome dinner result if we are able to get a tour at Pixar.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2280866958049381492?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">This morning started out like any other morning.  The alarm went off at 6:15 so that we could get up and get on our way to the everglades.  We left the Embassy Suites and walked down 17th Avenue toward the intercostal waterway where we were picking up our rental car.  On the way we split our forces with half of us going to Einstein&#8217;s Bagel Shop and half to Starbucks for Tea, Chai Latte and Cocoa.<br /><br />We beat the traffic heading out of town easily on our way to the Sawgrass recreation park.  It is part of the Everglades national park.  We had an appointment with Captain Randy and his airboat at 8:00.  Our instructions were to meet him 1/2 mile past mile marker 38 on highway 27.  We got there early, the sun was still pretty low in the sky and finished our breakfast in the small parking lot.  A few minutes later a pickup truck pulling an airboat with seating for nine pulled into the lot.  We watched as the captain fired up the 500 horsepower Corvette engine hooked up to a four blade airline propellor.  After the short checkout period he backed the boat and trailor into the water and brought the boat around to the ground.<br /><br />We greeted Captain Randy, who showed us onto the boat and gave us a short intro to our safety equipment, which consisted of headphones to protect our eardrums from the sound of the engine and airplane prop.  He invited one of us to join him in the topmost pair of seats as the co-pilot.  We took off, and after a short lesson in steering the airboat, push forward for right and pull back for left, he turned the steering over to me.  Driving an airboat takes a lot more anticipation than driving a ski boat.  When you want to turn a corner on one of the trails in the everglades you need to start doing so a few seconds in advance.  Luckily if you cut the corner to sharp, or too late you really don&#8217;t run into any problems.  You make the trail a little wider as you mow down the Sawgrass and cattail, but there seems to be enough of both to go around.<br /><br />Taking the early morning trip was a great idea as the angle of the sun was just beautiful, and we saw hundreds of birds as we cruised through the trails.  We saw hawks, and herons, and vultures and birds of all different colors and varieties.   In addition to the birds we were always on the lookout for gators.<br /><br />Captain Randy seems to have come from a long line of Everglades boat captains that have been involved with all kinds of dubious activities.  Pappy was an alligator poacher, and Randy and his brother kept small alligators as pets when they were younger.  As Captain Randy fed one of the gators along the way hotdogs and marshmallows he informed us that feeding the gators was strictly against the law.  That didn&#8217;t stop him, and we got some great pictures of Randy feeding his Mi Amoure Catalyna.<br /><br />Shortly after our gator feeding experience, we reached the farthest point on our tour.  By this point we were all pretty comfortable with the boat and so I was sitting in the bow taking pictures and the rest of the family was comfortably spread around.  Randy headed the boat down a narrow trail and suddenly I noticed that we were boating in mud instead of water.  As the mud got thicker and drier the boat went slower and slower until we finally came to a halt.  Stuck in the mud!<br /><br />After trying to gun the giant engine on our airboat for many minutes Randy finally admitted that we were stuck and going to need some help getting out.  At this point we learned a couple of things about Randy&#8217;s friend Lyle.  First, Lyle had an extremely long message on his business phone, and his cell phone.  Second we learned that Randy had helped Lyle out of a similar situation just a couple of days ago.  After failing to reach Lyle by phone we resorted to the old fashioned VHF radio.  &#8220;Laxahatchie, Laxahatcie, Laxahatchie, Lyle this is Randy are you there, over&#8230;.&#8221;  With those words our 3-hour tour became a rescue mission.<br /><br /> Our airboat was partway down a trail that had been drained of water.  We were about 150 feet onto the mud and it looked like the mud continued for another 300 before it rounded a bend.  The trick was to turn the airboat around and pull it out the short way.  Unfortunately in the Everglades walking on mud is not so easy.  When Randy got out of the boat to try and use a rope to turn us around he sunk up nearly to his waist.  To get back to the edge of the water required him to crawl on hands and knees to distribute his weight.<br /><br />The four of us stayed in the boat feeling somewhat amused at our situation.  Clearly we were not in any sort of life threatening emergency but for Randy this was clearly a pain in the butt and probably somewhat of an embarrasment.  We were not dressed to jump in the mud and help him, although Kaia seemed very willing to do so.  Josh was protecting his new green and white Nikes that Grandpa Miller bought him for Christmas but other than that I think he would have helped too.   I had on a brand new pair of Tommy Bahama shorts that I was definitely not interested in getting covered in Everglades mud.<br /><br />The rescuue mission was long and tedious as Lyle&#8217;s big boat could not turn around at the end of our trail.  This required the help of a third airboat driven by a kind stranger.  The third boat acted as  a tug boat getting Lyle in the proper position and ferrying the rope into Randy when necessary.<br /><br />The procedure that Randy and Lyle determined for getting us out involved tieing a line to the bow of the boat and then pulling with Lyle&#8217;s larger airboat.  To a physicist this seemed like a dumb idea as the angles involved were all wrong, but neither Randy or Lyle were physicists so this was not an issue.  After breaking Randy&#8217;s bowline there was some thought that the way to resolve the issue would be to bring a couple of pieces of plywood so that the tourists would be able to walk out of the trail but going from plank to plank and moving the planks as we made progress.<br /><br />Walking the tourists out was not an acceptable plan to Captain Randy.   It was clear that Lyle&#8217;s larger rope needed to be connected directly to the bow of our airboat and then threaded through the side of the boat about halfway back.  Randy decided that he would get to the side with a second rope and pull to try and provide the needed force vector to get the boat to turn to the side.  After several long pulls we finally had the boat turned at a ninty degree angle to our original course.  (This only took about three hours to get us to this position).<br /><br />We repositioned the rope to the bow of Randy&#8217;s ship and he got in his captains chair.  At this point the plan was to have one last pull by Lyle with Randy ready to &#8220;Give her Hell&#8221; as soon as we were headed in roughly the right direction.  With this plan in mind and one last pull we were finally free!<br /><br />Once free of the mud we followed Lyle back to his docking area where hugs were exchanged and many thumbs up were given to our kind helpers.   By this time Captain Randy had completely missed his 11:30 trip and was wanting to make sure we got back to the landing in time to meet his 2:30.  So we took off for home base at high speed.  After a while he slowed down so that Jane or Josh could drive.  Josh wanted to have nothing to do with driving as by this time he was convinced that he would do something even worse than get us stuck in the mud.  So Jane took her turn and did a great job of driving the boat.<br /><br />Just before we got back to the landing we made one last stop with captain Randy to make sure that we had our stories straight.  Clearly he was a little nervous that his muddy appearance might be offputting to his next group.  Particularly if we were unhappy and complaining about the trip.  He really had no reason to worry, all of us thought the trip was a great adventure.<br /><br />After our exciting airboat trip we planned to stop at the Sawgrass Mill, an enormous shopping center.  It took us almost a half hour of driving around to find the Ron Jon outlet store.  Even after we found it it took forever to get in because the parking lot was so busy and full.  The plan was for us to stop there to get Kaia a swimming suit.  Since I had discovered that my old suit was too big for me I decided to get one too.  Josh also found himself a nice suit and a football for using in the water.<br /><br />The next big surprise of the night came when we walked over to Pazzo&#8217;s for an italian dinner.  We walked in the door and talked to the hostess who told us to wait just a minute as she checked the tables.  As we stood waiting for a minute a familiar figure came across the bar headed toward us.  Sasan Mokhtari and his family were in the restaurant!  they were in town for the soccer tournament.  It was really fun to reconnect with Sasan after several years.  We had a great talk with Sasan and Mary and their kids Tara, Eva, and Daniel.  Tara is a first year at MIT and Eva and Daniel have transferred to Breck.   It took Sasan only about 3 minutes to ask me if I would be interested in doing some consulting for him!<br /><br />We had a great meal, although Josh was feeling a little sick and didn&#8217;t eat very much.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7763680025059074412?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Here&#8217;s a little script that combines two of my favorite pass times.  Python programming and cycling.  bonktown.com is a great site that has steep discounts on road cycling gear.  They only sell one item at a time and they typically sell that item until it is gone.  I&#8217;ve gotten some great deals on clothing and other stuff on that site.  Bonktown helps you know whats currently for sale in a number of ways, including a nice dashboard widget that pops up a notifier when something new comes on sale.  The problem is that over time I&#8217;ve started to ignore the growl notifiers for bonktown, because I&#8217;m not interested in lots of the stuff they sell.<br /><br />So, I wrote this python script that allows me to look for the stuff I am interested in buying.  It works by having a file of regular expressions that I use to search the item descriptions when something goes on sale at bonktown. If the item matches something I&#8217;m looking for then I get a Growl notification.  If not then I don&#8217;t hear about it.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s the code:<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint" style="overflow:auto;"><br />#!/usr/bin/env python2.6<br /><br />import re<br />import urllib<br />from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup<br />import Growl<br /><br />name = "MyBonk"   # was BonkMe<br />notifications = ["search_hit"]<br />notifier = Growl.GrowlNotifier(name,notifications)<br />notifier.register()<br /><br /># Read file of search Terms<br />myTerms = open("/Users/bmiller/lib/bonk_items.txt").readlines()<br /><br /><br /># Get the latest page<br />bt = urllib.urlopen("http://www.bonktown.com")<br /><br />doc = BeautifulSoup(bt.read())<br /><br />itemlist = doc.findAll(id=re.compile("item_title"))<br />price = doc.findAll(id=re.compile("price"))<br />desc = doc.findAll(id=re.compile("item_description"))<br /><br />for term in myTerms:<br />    for i in range(len(itemlist)):<br />        if itemlist[i] and re.search(term[:-1],itemlist[i].contents[0],re.IGNORECASE):<br />            notifier.notify("search_hit",<br />                            itemlist[i].contents[0],<br />                            desc[i].contents[7].contents[0],<br />                            sticky=False)<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />This script makes use of several modules:<br /><ul><br /><li>Growl</li><br /><li>BeautifulSoup</li><br /><li>urllib</li><br /><li>re</li><br /></ul><br /><br />I would have liked to use one of the standard library html/xml parsers, but I could not find one that was as convenient or easy to use as BeautifulSoup.  If you can tell me how to parse messy html with one of the standard library xml modules please let me know.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1449130420935951350?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
