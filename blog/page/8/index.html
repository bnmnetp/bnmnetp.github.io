  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was a beautiful two days in Buenos Aires.  Lets start with moving in to our room on the ship.  Other than the taxi driver overcharging us dumb Americans for the ride from the airport to the Puerta de Crucera everything about the checkin process went very well.  Our room is great, we have this curved wall of windows that makes you feel like you are just suspended out over the water.  Our sitting area is really a great place to just hang out and watch the sea go by.  The luggage all arrived intact, and we were even able to smuggle a few bottles of wine we picked up at the airport onto the ship.</p><p>We had two nice surprises on checkin:  First, our room is close enough to the Internet Cafe that we actually get a wireless signal in the room, and because we are in a suite we get 180 minutes of free wireless.  That may not last the whole trip but its a good start.  The second surprise was that we had a complimentary meal at the SS United States for our first night on the ship.  This is the only specialty restaurant on board, and it is definitely a good one.</p><p>It was hard to choose from the menu there were so many good options.  I had Diver Scallops wellington with truffle emulsion, Lobster Bisque, Surf &amp; Turf (more lobster tail for the surf part) and of course chocolate souffle for desert.  Jane had similar except she had a pear and goat cheese tart instead of the diver scallops, and a salad instead of the bisque. We washed it all down with a nice bottle of Far Niente Chardonnay.</p><p>When we were leaving the restaurant the cruise director happened to be outside the door taping a segment for the next days onboard news and information channel.  We waited until we though it was safe for us to sneak by him inconspicuously, but that was not to be.  He spotted us and pulled us over for a quick on camera interview about our dining experience.  So, now we are famous for a few days.</p><p>Our second day in BA was even better than the first.  The main activity for the day was a delta river cruise.  Just north of Buenos Aires is a huge river delta, formed by the Plata river as it finishes its journey from the mountains of brazil and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.  We met our tour guides out front of the cruise terminal and they drove us through the city, pointing out interesting sites along the way.  Actually our driver and the owner of the company, Gaston, didn&#8217;t say too much since he did not speak English, but our guide and interpreter did a great job.</p><p>We arrived at the Marina and got on board the boat.  It was a beautiful new 30 foot cabin cruiser, perfect for river cruising.  We took off up one of the main channels and just cruised along enjoying the sun and warm weather.  We laughed a bit at the fact that there are actually billboards along the side of the channel.  This gives you an idea of the amount of water traffic that uses this part of the river.  In fact the delta is home to a lot of people who commute by boat, and is the equivalent of going up to the lake for many other BA residents.  Everything in the delta uses water for transportation.  Everything from grocery delivery to garbage pickup is done by water.</p><p><img title="IMG_1960.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWzEP0nUqJI/AAAAAAAAAMo/TU4L0yis0u4/IMG_1960.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1960" width="400" height="266" /></p><p>Need some groceries?  You just put a bag over the end of a pole on your dock and the grocery boat will stop for you.  On garbage day you just hang your bags of garbage out on the end of the dock and the garbage boat takes them away.</p><p><img title="IMG_1961.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWzESZaSOZI/AAAAAAAAAMs/jZpA4wQhhIU/IMG_1961.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1961" width="400" height="266" /></p><p>After cruising through some residential areas we anchored in a very peaceful side channel to have some lunch&#8230; A nice local cerveza and some meat and cheese.  It was good, and light, which was perfect since we were still plenty full from our meal the night before.  Note to mike and Sarah, We signed up for six sessions of boot camp while we are on board, and although the first session was during our tour, we did work out before hand!</p><p>After the tour we got dropped off in downtown Buenos Aires where we walked through the busy city streets, and looked at the shops and bought a souvenir for Josh.  Josh:  check out the Buenos Aires football clubs.</p><p>Of course we had the obligatory lifeboat drill, but then we enjoyed our sail away from Beuenos Aires in our room:<img title="IMG_1981.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWzEW2wJ5fI/AAAAAAAAAM0/m4tAHMhdCYk/IMG_1981.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1981" width="400" height="266" /></p><p><img title="IMG_1969.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWzEUgChxaI/AAAAAAAAAMw/7AunZKSLL3Y/IMG_1969.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1969" width="400" height="266" /></p><p> </p><p>At dinner we went to our regular table in the main dining room, its located right next to the windows on the very back of the ship next to the captains table.  There was a little mixup at first with 10 of us thinking we belonged at this table for 8.  The waiter got that sorted out by moving this english couple to their proper table.  It seems that they were seated at our table the night before when 6 of us were eating at other places.  We really seem to have a nice table:  One couple from Houston TX, another from Ohio, she is the dean of a small college,  and another couple from New Jersey.  We had very good conversation, and it looks like it will be fun to get together and compare notes with them each night.</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8641071110192282145?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever had an experience where afterwards you said, &#8220;it took my breath away!&#8221;?  Today was one of those experiences for me.  I was awake, with the sun, at about 6:30 this morning;  3AM back in Decorah, but we were so tired from the previous two days that we were in bed before 10, and slept soundly through the night.  After having some coffee and breakfast in the hotel, Jane and I took off on the &#8220;Inferior Falls&#8221; hike.  The inferior falls trail is the lower trail that takes you down to the base of the falls and the river.  We were literally the only ones on the trail, and it seemed that around each turn there was a view of the falls more beautiful than the last.  I posted a bunch of photos to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/sets/72157626145929036/">flickr</a> account, its a lot of waterfall pictures, but you just can&#8217;t capture the beauty of it all with a camera.  I&#8217;ve been experimenting with the exposure bracketing feature of my camera, and so some of these are three images combined into one using the HDR editor on Aperture.</p><p>As we neared the bottom of the trail we spotted a pair Toucans up in the tree, along with several other interesting birds. You can see the Toucan in the picture below.   At this point we were also able to buy our tickets for the boat trip under the falls&#8230;.  But first there was a walkway that went right up to the falls.</p><p><img title="P2250043.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8EwDXVqI/AAAAAAAAAMM/7SUiVNXfKiM/P2250043.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Toucan Sam" width="600" height="450" /></p><p>I am the person in the mist in the picture below.  This was one of those wild kingdom kind of moments..  In your best Marlin Perkins voice you can say:  &#8221;While Jane stays safely dry at the beginning of the platform Brad will tame the raging river and get drenched.&#8221;  And this was the experience that literally took my breath away.  You just can&#8217;t believe the force of the falls until you get right up to it like I did.  The wind that is created by the crashing of the water is like being in a thunder storm, and before I even realized what was going on, I was completely soaked from head to toe.  Between the force of the wind, and the perceived force of the water my breath just went right out of my lungs.</p><p> </p><p><img title="P2250051.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8G4fW_CI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/Lb-8VTD8Ktk/P2250051.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Brad in the falls" width="450" height="600" /></p><p>As I think about my own experience standing at the end of the platform, I have to wonder about the people that built this thing!  Who in their right mind would go to work each morning,  to build something where you were thinking that if you slipped, (and I&#8217;m sure that during construction it was plenty slippery) you would get smashed against the rocks below you by water with thousands of pounds of force.</p><p>There is lots of wildlife in the park, we saw many species of birds, and a little hamster size rodent.  Others in our group saw a snake eating a frog &#8211; sorry I missed that one.  But the most prevalent creature were these little things that we though were ringtail lemurs, but the locals had a different name for them.  Here&#8217;s one of them begging lunch off another tourist.  Their snouts are quite long, and we were told that they are a member of the anteater family.</p><p><img title="IMG_1865.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8YZyoY5I/AAAAAAAAAMg/ZsFzI9z3nGA/IMG_1865.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="lunch" width="600" height="400" /></p><p>After our experience on the platform, our next goal was the boat ride.  On this ride you get some great views of the falls from the river, and assuming you have a waterproof camera, some good pictures.  Then after you have seen the beauty of the falls the captain of the boat plays a game called &#8220;lets see how close to the falls we can get without going under.&#8221;  In the picture below you can see the boat ahead of us headed into the falls.  I&#8217;ll admit that when I was standing on dry land and watching this I was thinking to myself, &#8220;who in their right mind would get into a boat and do that?&#8221;  But, when we were actually in the boat it seemed perfectly safe, and the boat was very stable.</p><p><img title="P2250055.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8I6kXWUI/AAAAAAAAAMU/eNaogClPgDw/P2250055.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Into the falls" width="600" height="450" /></p><p>Jane had the Flip video camera inside a waterproof bag when we got on the boat but mostly the video is a wall of white, and sound.  Here&#8217;s a little bit of video from when we are near the falls, but not yet in the roiling water:</p><p><img title="VID00030.MP4" src="marsedit://pending/29C2A8FB-AD3E-4932-9B9C-B84C6917C8C2/" border="0" alt="Falls Video" /></p><p>We were really glad we did the boat ride, as we got to see the even larger Brazilian falls that you can&#8217;t see from the hiking trails in Argentina.</p><p>After hiking back up to the hotel, we picked up my camera and got a new battery for the waterproof camera and set out for the train ride to El Diablo, this is another cool little hike where you go out to the top of the very large falls, and stand and watch the water spill over.  The water levels are quite high this year which makes everything even more spectacular.  Here&#8217;s a couple of shots from the top of the falls.  Again, there are more without me in them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/sets/72157626145929036/">flickr</a>.</p><p> </p><p><img title="IMG_1855.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWq8WELR3nI/AAAAAAAAAMc/0Zx2PlJLpHo/IMG_1855.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1855" width="600" height="400" /></p><p>After all of this hiking in the Jungle heat and humidity, we were quite tired and hot, so we headed back to the pool at the hotel to relax and rest up for a while.  Our final stop of the day was back in the city of Puerto Iguazu where we had a dinner reservation at Aqva restaurant.</p><p>We booked a round trip cab ride (200 pesos) at the front desk, which turned out to be a great deal.  We had a very personable cab driver named Ronny, who took us for a little site seeing and shopping before dropping us off at the restaurant.  After dropping us off he waited for us to eat and then took us back to the hotel.  Before dinner we had a beautiful view of the river from the city, where you can see Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay at the three corners of where the river splits.</p><p>The restaurant is decorated in Pacific Northwest style, and the food is a great blend of Argentinian and Italian cuisine.  We had a fantastic meal of Argentine steak and a lovely bottle of Malbec.  My steak came with a leak tart which was surprisingly delicious, and Jane had potatoes that were stuffed with cheese and ham.  The service was top notch, and we had the opportunity to chat with the owner, Jorge Antonio, who was very nice&#8230;. We topped off our dinner with a tiny bit of Limoncello.  The Limoncello was quite possibly the best we have ever tasted, so we asked the owner if he made it himself or imported it from Italy.  He said he made it himself and promised to share his top secret recipe with us if we sent him an email.  Just when we thought we were ready to leave the owner brought us a complimentary glass of Argentinian champagne to keep us happy for the ride back to the hotel.  If you get to Iguazu you should definitely check out Aqva.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5151263568237331527?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And so it begins.  Another travel adventure.  This one just Jane and I.  The itinerary is a South American Cruise from Buenos Aires, Argentina around Cape Horn and up to Valparaiso, Chile; with many stops along the way.  Here&#8217;s a summary of Days one and two.</p><p>We left Decorah with our friends John and Llew at 8:00AM to drive to the airport, we have several plans for getting back from the airport &#8211; the nice thing is that we didn&#8217;t need to park our car at $20 per day for 16 days.  While we are away Josh and our God daughter Liz are in charge of the house.  Decorah friends take note of that last sentence!  We are flying American all day, and of course the first face I see when we get to the American Counter is the infamous Cat &#8211; see my first post from JTerm travels.  Luckily we got our luggage checked in just fine without her.  When we got to the gate we checked with the gate agent to see if we could change our seats on the Dallas to Buenos Aires portion of the flight.  I really wanted to find a seat with a power port.  Nine hours in the air could require a recharge of the iPad.  She was so nice that she moved us to a bulkhead/exit row seat &#8211; nine hours of legroom!!</p><p>The rest of the air travel was uneventful, and we arrived in BA right on time.  Jane and I both managed at couple of hours of napping during the night, but nothing particularly restful.  BA is 3 hours ahead of central time so jet lag is not going to be a big factor.  Once off the plane we had to go through immigration and passport control.  We have to pay $140 each to visit Argentina, this is listed as reciprocity for the Visas that we make the Argentinians pay.</p><p>The plan was to get through immigration as quickly as possible and get on our car to the other airport (Jorge Newberry) where we are taking a flight to Iguazu for two days before the cruise.   We had reserved the 3:05 flight but were really hoping to get to the airport in time for the 11:35 flight.  We knew it would be tight but were hoping to avoid spending valuable hours in the airport.  Here&#8217;s where the plan started to fray&#8230;  After paying our reciprocity fee we got shunted out of the line for people from the US into the line for Argentinians and other visitors.  This line ended up being much longer and slower.  As the minutes ticked away we resigned ourselves to an afternoon in the airport.  We did meet two very nice women who were traveling alone, one was going to antarctica as part of an academic expedition and the other was celebrating her birthday by going horseback riding.</p><p>We ended up sharing our car with Denise &#8211; the horseback rider &#8211; The drive from BA International to Jorge Newberry is supposed to take anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours depending on who you read and what time of day, our drive was a harrowing 45 minutes.  Drivers here make up their own lanes and rules as they go along.  We got to the airport just after 11:00 which we were sure was too late for the 11:35 flight.  But luck was with us and the flight was delayed by an hour, so we were able to change to the earlier flight  &#8211; with no change fee!</p><p>We cleared security and found our way to gate 3 where we met up with several people from the cruise critic message board, I&#8217;ll just call them the CC people until I get to know them better.  Jane has been conversing online with some of these people for almost a year, and it was fun to meet up with some fellow americans to pass the time.</p><p>We arrived at the Iguazu airport, and the plane parked at one of the two gates.  We waited forever for Jane&#8217;s bag, and then got a cab to the Sheraton, which is located in the Iguazu National Park.  To summarize, we left Decorah at 8:00AM on the 24th and we arrived in Iguazu at 3:00 on the 25th.  A long days of travel! Just as we left the airport it started to rain, hard!  But, by the time we got checked in to our room and started to think about what to do with the rest of the day the rain stopped again.</p><p>Iguazu is amazing!  The falls here are huge, you just can&#8217;t believe the volume of water that pours over these things every second.  For those of you as old as me who are into movies at all, these falls are the sight of the movie The Mission.  Here&#8217;s one picture to whet your appetite.</p><p><img title="IMG_1817_8_9_tonemapped.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TWjg4GvZGAI/AAAAAAAAAME/U9X7A0KvYc8/IMG_1817_8_9_tonemapped.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 1817 8 9 tonemapped" width="400" height="600" /></p><p>I took this one on what is called the upper falls hike.  Its probably the driest hike we are going to take.  Next up is the lower falls hike which I will do in my swimsuit, and a boat ride that goes right up to the falls.</p><p>To finish off the story of our first day, we met up with the CC group again to have a drink in the hotel bar and dinner together.  I think this is going to be very nice to know a few people going into the cruise.  The dinner was pretty good.  Jane had seafood risotto and I had a nice Argentine steak.  The funniest thing was that Jane got dripped on through a leak in the roof when the rain started up again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-512103486512550459?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve recently been looking for ways to run Python in a browser.  There are lots of reasons why I think this is a cool idea.  For example, creating some simple tutorials, Making some online quizzes and tests, getting Python to run on my iPad&#8230;<br /><br />It looks like there are two projects that are actively working on solving this problem.  The first is called skulpt  (see the demo on <a href="http://www.skulpt.org/">skulpt.org</a>.)  This project actually reimplements the core of Python in Javascript by hand.  They are working on some modules, but right now it is basically the core Python language.<br /><br />The other project uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/emscripten/">Emscripten</a> to compile the CPython C source code to javascript!  Yep you read that right.  You can see <a href="http://syntensity.com/static/python.html">here</a> that the core of Python 2.7 is running.  You can import sys, but thats about it.  Nevertheless both of these are really useful for beginning Python exercises.<br /><br />The problem with both of these is that right now there is no user level documentation.  Skulpt is particularly difficult as you can&#8217;t even look at the demo page to see how its done.  You need to go digging through some additional source files from the distribution to figure out how to make it work for yourself.  The source code of the syntensity page is pretty easy to follow.  So here&#8217;s a hello world program using skulpt.<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint" style="overflow: auto;">&lt;script src="skulpt.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br /><br />&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />function outf(text) {<br />   var mypre = document.getElementById("output");<br />   mypre.innerHTML = mypre.innerHTML + text;<br />}<br /><br />function runit() {<br />   var prog = document.getElementById("yourcode").value;<br />   var mypre = document.getElementById("output");<br />   mypre.innerHTML = '';<br />   Sk.configure({output:outf});<br />   try {<br />      eval(Sk.importMainWithBody("&lt;stdin&gt;",false,prog));<br />   } catch (e) {<br />      alert(e);<br />   }<br />}<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;Try This&lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;form&gt;<br />&lt;textarea edit_id="eta_5" id="yourcode"&gt;<br />print "Hello World"<br />&lt;/textarea&gt;<br />&lt;button onclick="runit()" type="button"&gt;Run&lt;/button&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br /><br />&lt;pre id="output"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Its a bit on the verbose side, and it could certainly be improved so that less code would have to be replicated if you wanted to put multiple input/output areas on a single page, but as a learning example I think it works OK.  The try/catch block around the Sk.importMainWithBody function call will capture Python runtime errors and throw them.  This is a nice way to inform your users of syntax errors in any code they are trying out.<br /><br />I&#8217;m certainly no expert in either implementation, I just offer this post as an example and a time saver for anyone else trying to get going with either implementation.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7271951656985409817?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>4:00 PM Laguardia Airport</p><p>I have never wanted to be home so badly in all my life.  The group of 16 is sitting here in the American Eagle concourse of Laguardia.  We are at the airport very early for several reasons.  Number one, they are remodeling the lobby of the Seafarers and it sounded like the entire building was going to fall down.  Number two, the &#8220;seafarers&#8221; watching TV on the Mezzanine were on their second bottle of alcohol (gin for breakfast and whiskey for lunch) and were starting to creep everyone out.  Number three we though that this mornings snow might have traffic all backed up and we didn&#8217;t want to be fretting our way through security, but as it turned out we got over here in no time at all.  Number five, we feared that there would be long lines at checkin and security due to flight changes and cancellations, which also proved to be a non-issue.  So, here we sit, two hours before boarding, the flight is on time so far&#8230;</p><p>The morning started out early, I was wide awake at 4AM, my mind on the trip home today.  We had to be out the door at 7AM to catch our train to Stamford Connecticut, where we visited NBC.  We had two great speakers today John Fritsche, and Bucky Gunt (Google him, he&#8217;s won a ton of Emmys).  Unfortunately as we were on the train to Stamford some lovely white flakes of snow began to come out of the sky.  Sadly in New York even a few white flakes raise havoc with the schedules at Laguardia, Newark, and JFK.  On top of that tomorrow there is a winter storm watch out for our area.</p><p>Backing up to this morning again.  We got to the Union Square station where we were going to take any of the uptown bound trains to grand central station.  We told everyone, if the cars are crowded meet up on the platform  The cars were indeed crowded but after our london experience you would not believe how proficient our students have become at jamming themselves onto a subway.  So we all made it onto the train.  But not 30 seconds after we got off both Craig and I came up one student short.  I knew that student was on the train because I saw him and talked to him on the way to grand central.  But just like that he was gone!  Where did he go?  Did he fail to &#8220;mind the gap?&#8221;  Was he abducted by a band of roving gypsies?  Did a crazed herd of subway rats drag him away?  We had to move to the platform to catch our train to Stamford and unfortunately this student did not have his cell phone along.  So one stayed behind until the last possible minute to see if he returned, and the rest of us went on to catch our Stamford train.  Sadly, we had lost him.  Well, I knew that other than missing the NBC presentations he would be fine.  He could always go back to the hotel and meet us there later.</p><p>As we were standing in the snow in Stamford he finally called.  He was at a pay-phone and was safe and sound.  He had gone up the stairs following someone in a coat that looked suspiciously like Craig&#8217;s.  After following not-craig for a while he finally realized that he was following the wrong guy.  By then he didn&#8217;t know how to get back to us and we were probably gone by then anyway.  We are all hopeful that this will be the final mass transit mishap of the trip!  &#8211; A short update craig just surmised that our inbound plane is 20 minutes ahead of schedule.  So, the good news is that we have an inbound plane, it is in the air, and it is ahead of schedule.  Yea!!</p><p>5:30  Well, scratch that&#8230; Our plane is actually now going to arrive about 16 minutes late.  It took off late from Charlotte, so is behind schedule.</p><p>9:23 CST:  Finally off the plane, after landing only about a minute late we were informed by the captain that an AA 737 landed just 10 seconds ahead of us.  Unfortunately they only have one ground crew so we wait on the tarmac unable to pull into our gate.  Finally we pull into the gate but we wait another 10 minutes before someone finally moves the jet bridge into place.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that was Cat having her final revenge on me for publicly calling her out in an earlier post.</p><p>But, all is well that ends well.  Even though we waited a long time (25 minutes) to get off the plane, our luggage was waiting for us at baggage claim, so there was no additional wait there.  By 10PM Craig and I were in my car, yes my car, freedom, no reliance on public transportation, no waiting for cranky gate agents, we could just get in my car and drive the last 2:20 minutes to get home to Decorah.  We arrived just after midnight.  Sweet.  It was a great trip, but there&#8217;s no place like home.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6608147763903952442?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div><ol><li><strong>My Family</strong> &#8211; This has been a great trip,and I think everyone has been getting along very nicely.  Its fun to watch a mixed group of students come together and form new friendships over the course of a couple of weeks.  At least one trip romance has blossomed.  But, I miss my wife, and I have missed way too many basketball games.  I keep watching the video of Josh&#8217;s first varsity game over and over.</li><li><strong>My House</strong> &#8211; We have had some pretty nice accommodations along the way, and a few sketchy ones as well.  Sadly, the last two days here in New York are the worst of the trip.  A couple of the students just told me that they slept with their winter coats on last night because their room was so cold!  My room was warm, and the sheets were clean but the whole place is pretty worn and grimy looking.  And, there is just one kind of gross shower for each half of our floor.  But the quiet!!  The week in London at the &#8220;Royal National&#8221;  was not very royal but again the sheets and rooms were clean and I had my own nice clean bathroom.  By far the best of the trip was the hostel in Interlaken.  But I am so looking forward to getting home to my own bed and my own shower, and my own hot water and tea&#8230;</li><li><strong>Cooking for myself</strong> &#8211; Its been fun enjoying the local cuisines along the way.  Germany:  Schnitzel and Wurst and the beer at the Hofbrau house.  Switzerland: Interlaken more good german food but Lausanne was not so interesting.  Torino:  We had an awesome little meal at a neighborhood restaurant in Torino and some other good pasta options as well.  The challenge was finding restaurants that could accommodate all of us.  Most of them were pretty small so to fit the entire group we ended up using some cafeteria style places where everyone could work their way through.  London:  Good Indian, Chinese, and of course the fish and chips at the pubs was really good.  But, I&#8217;m ready to cook some of my favorites and just eat a little less!</li><li><strong>My Routine</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m such a creature of habit.  I miss getting up in the morning and doing Kettlebells, I miss getting up and just going up to my office to quietly read the news and have a cup of tea.  On the road I have to shower and get dressed before I can go find someplace to sit, and read, and even then it is not quiet, its someplace like starbucks or some local coffee joint that is bustling with activity.  I end up not reading and people watching.</li><li><strong>Playing 500</strong> &#8211; Another great part of the rhythm of my life at home is gathering on the weekends to play cards with friends.  Around the table we catch up, discuss Decorah and National politics, parenting, and whatever.  Some nights are really intense, and some nights can be downright depressing if the cards are bad.  But nobody really remembers who won or lost a week later.</li><li><strong>Decorah</strong> &#8211; Three weeks of being in big cities really reminds me of all the things I appreciate about our community.  I love going into a restaurant and knowing the staff, and knowing that while I eat my lunch I&#8217;m going to see people I know and have the chance to catch up with them.  I miss having my coffee at Java Johns were again I know the staff, and all of the interesting people that come in each morning.  I miss the smallness and familiarity.</li></ol></div><div></div><div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4352687159455891480?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So today Craig and I had an afternoon to do some site seeing.  Despite the cold cold temperatures here in new york we decided to start with some Dim Sum.  So, we headed to Chinatown.  I took out the trusty Urbanspoon app on my phone and we were soon headed to Ping&#8217;s.  Good Dim Sum at a great price.  Great shrimp and pork dumplings, Great potstickers and fried spring rolls.  The beef short ribs were OK, but not my favorite.  We finished up with some fried bacon wrapped shrimp.  A great way to close out the meal.  We were stuffed and only a few bucks poorer.</p><p>After lunch we headed up to 30 rock to do the studio tour and visit Top of Rock.  The studio tour was fun.  We saw Dr. Oz&#8217;s studio (who??) and the Jimmy Fallon set, also home to Johnny Carson&#8217;s show when he was in New York.  Finally we saw the SNL set.  Lots of great memorabilia and great memories in looking at that set.  Unfortunately there is a no picture policy on the tour so nothing to share there.</p><p>What I can share is this video clip.  Partway through the tour, our guides asked for a couple of volunteers to &#8216;do some reading&#8217;  Craig and I both volunteered, and it turned out they were going to show us how a mini news broadcast goes together.  So, Craig is the anchorman, and I am the weather guy.  Its not as easy as it looks standing in front of the green screen, reading the teleprompter, and moving pointing at something nonexistent behind you.</p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="225" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"><param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=d8e0373a91&photo_id=5402162164"></param><param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=d8e0373a91&photo_id=5402162164" height="225" width="400"></embed></object><p>Sadly Flickr uses flash to do these embedded videos, Here&#8217;s a link to the mov non flash file I uploaded&#8230; http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/5402162164/</p><p>After the tour we went up to the Top of Rock experience.  This is a great view of the city on a nice mostly clear day.  Here&#8217;s a few photos for you to enjoy the view from up there as well.  We had hoped to close out the afternoon with a happy hour cocktail at the Rainbow Room, but it was closed.</p><p><img title="IMG_2331.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TT9QQBlBJpI/AAAAAAAAALg/gVNYzxouN-I/IMG_2331.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2331.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img title="IMG_2336.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TT9QR4SNgxI/AAAAAAAAALk/TwVRQp8mOyE/IMG_2336.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2336.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p> </p><p><img title="IMG_2339.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TT9QTvmnxeI/AAAAAAAAALo/AwgkekoHeXA/IMG_2339.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2339.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5202653552439122819?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting in Starbucks off Union Square, its 6:30 here in Manhattan and I&#8217;m wide awake.  I made it until about 9:30 last night but then fell soundly asleep until 2:30AM, 8:30AM London time of course.  The relative quiet of my room at Seafarers International house was awesome.</p><p>The flight home was a Godsend as well.  I went up to the desk to ask if I could change from a center to an aisle seat.  The lady said no problem, she moved me to row 31 and said that it was likely nobody else would be beside me.  So yes, I had a whole row to myself for the flight home.  As it turned out we all could have had our own rows as the back third of the plane was pretty much empty.</p><p>Following all instructions we arrived at Heathrow three hours in advance of our flight, the Picadilly line was much more crowded that we expected it to be for 7:30 on a sunday morning.  But when we got to heathrow, there was no waiting at the continental desk to check in for our flight, and there was virtually no waiting in the security line either.  So, we had plenty of time to sit around the gate area and wait for our flight.  I think we all spent more time waiting to get through passport control at Newark than we did in the security line at Heathrow.</p><p>We just missed the 3:15 train to New York Penn Station, so we ended up having to wait there for the 4:04.  Every other hour of the day has an xx:28 train to Penn station except for 3pm.  Once we got into the city we had to get subway passes for everyone.  Unlike London, it is impossible in New York to use a credit card to by 26 unlimited passes.  So, we had to trudge to the Herald Square station and have everyone line up to use their own cards to get their subway passes for the two days here in New York.</p><p>Finally, about 4 hours after landing we made it to Seafarers.  It is midnight London time, but everyone was excited to eat some american food, and catch the end of the Packers, Bears game.  More american football was to come with the Steelers and the Jets.  Craig and I went to watch the end of the Packers game at TGI Fridays, and then headed out to Pete&#8217;s Tavern.  It was great to have an American hamburger, with blue cheese!  I loved the fish and chips at all of the london pubs, but it was really nice to be back home.  Although we are still a 3 hour flight from Minneapolis I feel like we are close enough to home to reach out and touch it.</p><p>Today we have a group  meeting at 9, then a speaker from NBC Olympics at 10.  Everyone is on their own for the day after our speaker, until we have our final group dinner tonight.  Tomorrow will be a busy day as we have a meeting in Connecticut, and then by mid afternoon the group will begin to disperse for the various flights back home.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5030927952139964923?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

We sat in the neutral zone of the stadium so we were not right in with the Fulham or the Stokes City fans.  So our section was a bit quieter than all the others.  We were the closest to the Stokes City visitors section and it was really a riot to listen to them sing, and chant, and carry on throughout the game.  They only quieted down about midway through the second half when it became very clear that there was no way they were going to win the game.</p><p>There were a couple of Dads right behind me that had brought their two young boys to the game, so it was interesting to listen to them explain football to the boys, who already knew as much about the game as many of us.  It was a great experience and one that I will remember fondly for a long time.</p><p>The last few days are really a blur.  We have had more great meetings and class discussions, and finally some time to explore the city on our own.  Quite honestly I&#8217;m &#8216;museumed out&#8217; at the moment.  I&#8217;ve been to The British Museum, The London Transportation Museum, the Tate Modern, The London Docklands, The Imperial War Museum, and the British Library.  All were interesting in their own way, but you get museum, and information overload at some point.</p><p>A couple of the highlights for me were the Transportation Museum, seeing the development of the London Underground, beginning in the 1830s and moving forward is a pretty interesting study in engineering, and city planning.   The development of tunneling technologies, and the escalator were really interesting.</p><p>Another highlight was seeing a letter from Ada Lovelace to Charles Babbage at the British Library.  The library has labelled this letter as the first computer program, as she is explaining how to program the difference engine to solve a mathematical problem that had never been solved by hand before.  Also at the Library was Handel&#8217;s original score for the Messiah!  You could see his notes as well as the names of the soloists that were performing the different parts.  They also have one of four copies of the Magna Carta on display.  This is a document written in 1215 or so, and is widely considered to be a model for our own constitution.</p><p>Last night we had our final group dinner in London, and the Imperial China restaurant.  We had our own room, with a Karaoke machine and a special menu.  Tons of food, and great fun was had singing karaoke by all.    Here you can see Paul, Joe, and Carl treating us to a country song.  We also had Rap, Glen Campbell, and even a couple of Disco numbers.  It is really strange to think that all of these students know the lyrics to every Backstreet boys song ever written.</p><p><img title="IMG_2305.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TTs3zOSV8BI/AAAAAAAAALY/3W0K3rSBHeQ/IMG_2305.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2305.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>Tomorrow is an early morning as we have to be on the Tube going to heathrow by 7:30.  We leave London at around 11:15am and arrive in New York at about 3:00pm.  We&#8217;ve all enjoyed our time in Europe, but we are also ready to be back in the states again.  I know that even after a proper football game this afternoon, a number of the students are hoping to make it</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3432422924557260243?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
