  <div class="entry-content"><p>I consider myself pretty up to speed on web development.</p>&#13;
<p>I’ve spent the last two days trying to find a hosting solution for the data structures eBook…. I looked at too many of the following:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Google App Engine — I’m a long time GAE user, but the setup I have uses sphinx to generate content on the fly which it wants to store in pickle files on the local file system.  This doesn’t work with a GAE and some other systems that treat the file system as read only and expect any writing you do to go to a database.</li>&#13;
<li>heroku — seems very promising, but I’m not sure how to configure web2py so it doesn’t need any local file system write access.  The lack of ssh access is a bit disconcerting.</li>&#13;
<li>dotcloud — seems promising but the app kept hanging for no discernible reason.  I fought with it for the better part of the afternoon before deciding to move on.</li>&#13;
<li>fluxflex — easy to get web2py installed, (1 minute)  but a real pain to try to work with a real app.  I’m not going to use the web interface for all my editing.  I want to git push and/or git pull to deploy and update the app.  It doesn’t seem possible to get both ease of installation and robust configuration management.</li>&#13;
<li>pythonanywhere - non-starter</li>&#13;
<li>webfaction — Its not free, but at least it has a command line I can work with and I’ve got the whole thing running.  The only confusing thing about webfaction is that they don’t list web2py as a supported framework, but when you type it in under other it magically works for  you….  The other annoying thing that I <em><strong>just</strong></em> discovered is that the 256MB limit is way too low for the default configuration.  I just now got a helpful email saying a support ticket had been opened for me because I was using too much memory.  This was like 15 minutes after I finally got my app running and I’d made about 5 page requests.</li>&#13;
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content">I can see the campus from my house, its about a 20 minute walk, all downhill for the first half of the trek, then slightly uphill the rest of the way to the Olin building. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always thought that biking to work would be the way to go, but I hate getting home all sweaty and gross. &nbsp;The problem is the uphill trek. &nbsp;From the River to My House is about a 300 foot climb over the course of just under a mile, a 6% grade for those who care to know. &nbsp;But trust me, its steep. &nbsp;It takes a lot of work to get up to my house, even on my road bike.<br />But, awhile back I was reading about some of the new electric assist bikes, and I thought hey, I haven&#8217;t bought a new bike in a long time. &nbsp;So, I started doing a bit more research and decided that one of the Trek Ride+ bikes would be great. &nbsp;I ended up with the Trek FX+. &nbsp;Sadly, my local bike shop can&#8217;t sell the Ride+ bikes, so I had to go to La Crosse to find this one. &nbsp;The good news is that this is a good time of the year to get a new bike! &nbsp; 30% off was the sale today.<br /><img alt="Trek FX+" border="0" height="223" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-oz5YYOkYY18/TpDG6iClFzI/AAAAAAAAAag/ngLF-wLwNTA/2011-10-08_16-13-01_814.jpg?imgmax=800" title="2011-10-08_16-13-01_814.jpg" width="400" /><br />I took it for a ride around LaCross and up the only little hill I could find, &nbsp;the Cass Ave Bridge, not much of a hill, but I knew I was on to something when I felt like I was riding on the flats with the wind at my back, when I was actually going up a little hill. &nbsp;After riding it around downtown a little longer I went back to the shop, smitten. &nbsp;The only decision was which panniers to get so I can haul groceries and my stuff to school.<br />Jane hasn&#8217;t ridden it yet, but I have the feeling I know what she&#8217;ll want for Mothers day. &nbsp;This would be the perfect option for our cycling marriage. &nbsp;I could ride my road bike and she could ride the electric assist. &nbsp;I think I see some longer bike rides together in our future :-)<br />The other great thing is that no gas is required. &nbsp;Its all battery operated, and as I coast down the hill the battery is recharged. &nbsp;I&#8217;lll be able to easily cruise my way to school, and then on the way home I can engage the electric drive at the bottom of the hill, and get the assistance I need to climb up to my house. &nbsp;I won&#8217;t arrive home sweaty, and I&#8217;ll have the satisfaction of knowing that I got a few extra minutes of exercise, and didn&#8217;t use any gas! &nbsp;The only downside is that I&#8217;ll be only inches away from the Whippy Dip as I ride home, but as long as I can get by there I&#8217;ll be fine.<br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7356015564165588778?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">I love it when a good plan comes together. &nbsp;Last summer we decided to finally take the plunge and build a pizza oven at the lake. &nbsp;After looking at the options to site the oven, and thinking about a fireplace/oven combination, we finally decided to combine the pizza oven project with our desire to replace the aging and increasingly ugly outdoor bar area.<br />In late June I contacted a few different stone masons to start to get an idea of cost and availability. &nbsp;I was immediately impressed with David Marek&nbsp;<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/www.layersofstone.com">www.layersofstone.com</a> and his ideas on the project. &nbsp;I checked some references and decided that my initial impression was correct, that David would be a good guy to work with. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s his original sketch of our project.<br /><br /><img alt="Brad Miller Plan" border="0" height="331" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Akb0ivIiOQI/TnixuYBvTlI/AAAAAAAAAYw/NFDsPjnfh68/Brad%252520Miller%252520Plan.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: left;" title="Brad Miller Plan.jpg" width="600" /><br /><br />David was able to start tearing out the old bar, and working on the replacement the last week of July. &nbsp;He just finished the project last week, in time for us to enjoy some Pizza with our friends this last weekend. &nbsp;The result was beyond my expectations. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a photo of the final outcome that you can compare with the plan:<br /><img alt="6162728834 2a3c8d4985" border="0" height="333" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rxZ0eI9DcHo/TnixvImNP2I/AAAAAAAAAY0/7drzQ7ZYWPU/6162728834_2a3c8d4985.jpg?imgmax=800" style="float: left;" title="6162728834_2a3c8d4985.jpg" width="500" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For more shots of the project you can check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/sets/72157627580626967/">Flickr Photo Set</a><br />Last saturday was the inaugural pizza baking. &nbsp;It took about two hours to get the oven fully up to temperature, but the wait was well worth it. &nbsp;We used this <a href="http://recipepad.appspot.com/showrecipe/aglyZWNpcGVwYWRyDgsSBlJlY2lwZRiRpA4M">crust recipe</a> and pre-baked the crusts on both sides for just a few seconds. &nbsp;The crusts came out very light and crunchy. &nbsp;I&#8217;m looking forward to trying out lots of different crust recipes, but this was definitely a winner.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2405740608151021074?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its fun to see my sabbatical project getting loose the wild.  It is always a bit scary to work on something creative and new and then let other people play with it and respond to it.  Such is the case with the new eBook I worked on during my sabbatical.  Unlike other eBooks that you may be aware of,  this book &#8211; in the words of Emeril &#8211; &#8220;kicks it up a notch&#8221;.  Using some cool open source javascript code that I&#8217;ve had to modify and bend a bit for my own use this book allows the reader to try their hand at Python right in the book.  Examples are fully runnable in two different ways.  Each section has an accompanying video.  My co-author, David Ranum and I are using this book in class this Fall and its fun to see how the students interact with the book.  We&#8217;ve had none of the usual Fall frustration at getting Python installed on students machines.  You can have a look at the book <a href="http://thinkcspy.appspot.com">here</a>.  Note, you&#8217;ll need a good modern browser, and a gmail account.  We&#8217;ve had the best success with Chrome and Safari.  Firefox 6 works but seems  a little flakey at times.</p><p>Yesterday Phil Wagner posted a nice little writeup about our project on his BrokenAirplane <a href="http://www.brokenairplane.com/2011/09/updated-python-how-to-think-like.html">blog</a>.</p><p>As I told Phil, this book is really a triumph of open source.  Here are the open source components we&#8217;ve used and modified for this project:</p><ul><li>The text in the book is based on the original How to Think Like a Computer Scientist by Jeff Elkner, et. al.  You can find the non-interactive version <a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/">here</a></li><li>The Python Interpreter is By Scott Graham and you can find out information about it at <a href="http://skulpt.org">Skulpt.org</a>.  This was a really key piece and although I&#8217;ve spent a ton of time creating a turtle graphics module for it, the book wouldn&#8217;t have gotten off the ground without it.  In the book the pieces we refer to as activecode  all make use of sculpt, along with the really nice javascript editor <a href="http://codemirror.net">Codemirror</a>.</li><li>What we call codelens in the book is based on work by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/">Philip Guo</a>.  I really like this part because students can step through the code a line at a time both forward and backward.</li><li>Finally, the glue that holds the whole thing together is the excellent <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> publishing system.  This really turned out to be the key as Sphinx lets you create new directives to use in writing.   I was able to add directives to sphinx to make it really easy to include the interactive features without getting in the way of the writing.</li></ul><p>I really think this Interactive Edition has huge possibilities for the future, I can see incorporating many other interesting kinds of visualizations, and video collections.  My future todo list is already very large, and I&#8217;m anxious to hear ideas from others as they use the book.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-726200996429097574?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its Thursday morning, and the earthquake drill is over.  Not that the drill took up any of our valuable time, all we had to do was put out a white towel to indicate that we were all OK.  The block captain surveys the block and then checks in with anyone that is not flying the white flag.  Walking around the block its as if the entire community of Heritage Palms has surrendered.</p><p>Its been a fun week, here in california with our friends Jim and Karen.  We rented bikes for the week from Big Wheel bikes and we&#8217;ve been on several rides.  Yesterday was a favorite, we rode from our house here to La Quinta (<a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/30256922/">http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/30256922/</a>)  Its nice and flat, and through plenty of busy roads, but the bike lanes here are nice and wide and all of the drivers are courteous  towards cyclists.  The greatest thing is that there are mountains everywhere you look.</p><p>Tuesday we drove over the mountains to Temecula.  We had a beautiful view looking back into the Coachella Valley.</p><p><a title="View 'IMAG0005' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/5556303038"><img title="IMAG0005" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5556303038_b943965a19.jpg" border="0" alt="IMAG0005" width="500" height="299" /></a></p><p>But a little while later we encountered some snow.  Yes, we came out here to get away from the snow only to drive into some in the mountains.  Its not nearly as bad as it is back home where the Twin Cities is getting hit with about a foot, and Kaia is getting even more than that in Moorhead.  Here&#8217;s Jim, Karen, and Jane having a snowball fight.</p><p><a title="View 'IMAG0009' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/5556304556"><img title="IMAG0009" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5556304556_e38ef2a5e0.jpg" border="0" alt="IMAG0009" width="500" height="299" /></a></p><p>Although we had a fun day in Temecula we didn&#8217;t really find any wine to fall in love with.  The best I tasted was the Viognier at Callaway.  We had some great pizza at the Temecula Pizza Company.  Half gorgonzola and pear, half turkey and cranberry with white sauce.  We also had a small pepperoni and sausage, just for the sake of scientific comparison.</p><p>Today the plan is to go up the tram in Palm Springs and do some hiking in the mountains, then grab some lunch in downtown Palm springs.  From there who knows what the day will bring, we only have another 36 hours before we head back to the snow and cold, so we&#8217;ve got to make the most of it.</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7260039007222519313?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think I said that the plan for today was to head to the Palm Springs tram, and do a little hiking at the top of the tram then enjoy a nice lunch in downtown Palm Springs.  But two minutes before we walked out of the house we changed our minds and decided to go to Joshua Tree National Park.  Since we both have boys named Joshua, and they are staying together while we are out here in California, it made sense for us to check out this national park.  We are glad we did.</p><p>The south entrance to Joshua Tree is only about 25 miles away from Indio, so its a short drive to get to the park.  But, once you are there you find out how huge the park is.  We drove another 23 miles through desert scrub before we got to some of the really interesting parts.  The Joshua Tree National Park is a mixture of climates, it is part Colorado Desert, and part Mojave Desert, microclimates abound.</p><p>Our first big stop was at the Cholla cactus garden, its weird how these pictures almost look like they are underwater photos of coral!</p><p>.<img title="IMAG0020.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_HhjcVDI/AAAAAAAAAQk/x5LD1VSaC3g/IMAG0020.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0020" width="359" height="600" /><img title="IMAG0016.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_k91ZpII/AAAAAAAAAQ4/etUUWx_C7N4/IMAG0016.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0016" width="200" height="119" /></p><p>In the national park there are these small mountain ranges that pop up out of nowhere that look like someone just drove in a huge dump truck and left a pile of rubble behind.  In fact these are all granite, and formed from volcanic activity.</p><p><img title="IMAG0021.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_N9vawnI/AAAAAAAAAQo/ZNN6A5zNAkI/IMAG0021.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0021" width="359" height="600" /></p><p>Because of all the different climates that are part of the park, the whole southern half of the park doesn&#8217;t even have any Joshua Trees!  You have to wait until you get to a little higher elevation which is in the north and west part of the park.  Here&#8217;s Jim and Karen standing under a very picturesque Joshua Tree.</p><p><img title="IMAG0035.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_VAQN4rI/AAAAAAAAAQs/JiaZwTJ_N5s/IMAG0035.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0035" width="359" height="600" /></p><p>The Joshua Tree gets its name from the mormon&#8217;s who saw it and thought that it reminded them of the prophet Joshua stretching his arms heavenward.  In fact the &#8220;tree&#8221; is part of the Yucca family.  It has extremely sharp  points on the end of the leaves which the loggerhead shrike (a bird) uses to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBrwLn1_e4I">kill its prey</a>!</p><p>Our last stop in the park was a great little hike in hidden canyon.  Here you can get a sense of how these little mountains were created out of blocks of granite.  Its amazing to see the Joshua Trees along with the scrub oak, and Juniper trees just growing out of the rocks.</p><p><img title="IMAG0039.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_b0vIQEI/AAAAAAAAAQw/h5_I9tSeoRM/IMAG0039.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0039" width="400" height="239" /></p><p>On the way home, we drove through the wind farm in the San Gorgonio pass.  This is a great site for a wind farm as the wind blows here all the time.  There are more than 4000 turbines here that generate enough power for the entire Coachella valley!  There are turbines here of all ages, some very old and very small, some with two blades, for working in higher winds, and some very new and large turbines.  Poor Jim, we discovered too late that you can get tickets for a tour of the wind farm!</p><p><img title="IMAG0046.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TYv_gx5dlcI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/HxV_bz2IVIg/IMAG0046.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMAG0046" width="400" height="239" /></p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6191267256825682802?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Now that I&#8217;m back from traveling in South America I&#8217;ve started on a project to add a turtle graphics module to skulpt. &nbsp;Skulpt is a javascript implementation of Python written by Scott Graham, and is available on skulpt.googlecode.com. &nbsp;Its a very nice project because it allows you to embed a Python interpreter right in your web page. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve written about how to do this <a href="http://blog.bonelakesoftware.com/2011/02/python-in-your-browser-in-javascript.html">in a previous post.</a><br />The skulpt interpreter works like a charm, but it does not yet have any of the Python standard library modules implemented. &nbsp;Scott has been working with wrapping some of Googles closure libraries, and has a webgl module too. &nbsp;But none of your regular Python friends are available, things like math, random, turtle, etc need to be implemented. &nbsp;For the most part these things are already available in javascript so the work is in creating the module and then wrapping the underlying Javascript inside the standard Python API.<br />Where to start? &nbsp;There&#8217;s not a lot of documentation provided for skulpt, so I&#8217;m hoping this post will be enough to help others get going a bit quicker. &nbsp;Scott was very helpful in responding to all my emails so this is not a criticism of him, rather I&#8217;m hoping this will save him the effort the next time someone wants to extend skulpt. &nbsp;So, here&#8217;s the deal. &nbsp;skulpt relies on two javascript files the first is skulpt.js &nbsp;and builtin.js &nbsp;A very minimal installation only uses skulpt.js, whereas if you want to use any modules they are in builtin.js. &nbsp;Looking around the distribution you will not immediately find skulpt.js because you need to build it. You get a sculpt.js file by using the m script that comes with the distribution. &nbsp;running m &#8211;help will give you the full list of commands, but the two that you probably most care about are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">m dist</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">m docbi</span> The dist command builds both skulpt.js and builtin.js &nbsp;docbi builds builtin.js and puts a new copy of it in the doc/static directory.<br />Lets begin with a quick tour of the source tree:<br /><ul><li><strong>src</strong> - contains the implementation of the Python interpreter</li><li><strong>src/lib</strong> - has the module implementations of webgl and goog. &nbsp;This is where turtle will live and any other modules I implement along the way.</li><li><strong>doc</strong> - This directory contains a google app engine application and is what you see on <a href="http://skulpt.org/">skulpt.org</a> There are a couple of important files to check out in here. &nbsp;One of them is doc/static/env/editor.js &nbsp;This is the code that ties together the interactive editor on the home page with the skulpt interpreter and the <a href="http://codemirror.net/">codemirror</a> editor. &nbsp;If you know how to build a google app engine app then this directory makes sense. &nbsp;One thing about the home page is that it is not set up to use any of the modules. &nbsp;The modules are used in the more advanced ide, which you can find in doc/ide/static. &nbsp;I&#8217;m going to tell you how to add modules to the simpler editor later in this article.</li><li><strong>test</strong> - this directory contains a bunch of files for testing the implementation in a batch mode. &nbsp;These tests are run whenever you run m dist, or m test.</li><li><strong>dist</strong> - This directory gets created and populated when you run the m dist command. &nbsp;It contains the built and compressed versions of skulpt.js and builtin.js</li></ul>To illustrate how to make use of modules, here&#8217;s an extended version of my earlier hello world style example.<br /><br /><pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;script src="skulpt.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script src="builtin.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/head&gt;<br /><br />&lt;body&gt;<br />&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />function outf(text) {<br />   var mypre = document.getElementById("output");<br />   mypre.innerHTML = mypre.innerHTML + text;<br />}<br /><br />function builtinRead(x)<br />{<br />    if (Sk.builtinFiles === undefined || Sk.builtinFiles["files"][x] === undefined)<br />        throw "File not found: '" + x + "'";<br />    return Sk.builtinFiles["files"][x];<br />}<br /><br />function runit() {<br />   var prog = document.getElementById("yourcode").value;<br />   var mypre = document.getElementById("output");<br />   mypre.innerHTML = '';<br />   Sk.configure({output:outf,<br />           read: builtinRead<br />              });<br />   try {<br />      Sk.importMainWithBody("&lt;stdin&gt;",false,prog);<br />   } catch (e) {<br />      alert(e);<br />   }<br />}<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;Try This&lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;form&gt;<br />&lt;textarea edit_id="eta_5" id="yourcode"&gt;<br />print "Hello World"<br />&lt;/textarea&gt;<br />&lt;button onclick="runit()" type="button"&gt;Run&lt;/button&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br /><br />&lt;pre id="output"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre><div></div><pre><br /></pre>There are some important differences between this version, and the version and the non-module version. &nbsp;First off, the call to Sk.configure contains another key value pair which sets up a specialized read function. &nbsp;This is the function that is responsible for returning your module out of the large array of files that are contained in the builtin.js file. &nbsp;You will see that all of the modules are contained in this one file, stored in a big JSON structure. &nbsp;The extra key value pair is:<br />read: builtinRead<br />The read function is just for loading modules and is called when you do an import statement of some kind. &nbsp;In this case the function accesses the variable builtinFiles which is created from the builtin.js file. &nbsp;The other difference, of course, is that you have to include builtin.js in your html file. &nbsp;Note that builtin.js must be included after skulpt.js<br />Now as far as the module itself goes, the easiest thing to do is to start your module in the src/lib directory. &nbsp;This way it will automatically get built and included in builtin.js. &nbsp;If you don&#8217;t put it there then you are going to have to modify the m script, specifically the docbi function in the m script to include your module. &nbsp;Suppose that you want to have a module called bnm.test &nbsp;Here&#8217;s what you have to do. &nbsp;First, you need to make a bnm directory under lib. &nbsp;In this directory you will need to have either __init__.py or __init__.js or bnm.js to stand in for the bnm module. &nbsp;There doesn&#8217;t need to be anything in the file as long as it exists. &nbsp;This is just like CPython by the way. &nbsp;Then to make a test module you can either make a test directory and put all your javascript code in __init__.js or you can simply create a test.js file in the bnm directory. &nbsp;Lets look at the test module.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">var $builtinmodule = function(name)<br />{<br />    var mod = {};<br />    var myfact = function(n) {<br /> if(n &lt; 1) {<br />     return 1;<br /> } else {<br />     return n * myfact(n-1);<br /> }<br />    }<br />    mod.fact = new Sk.builtin.func(function(a) {<br /> return myfact(a);<br />    });</pre><pre><br />    mod.Stack = Sk.misceval.buildClass(mod, function($gbl, $loc) {<br /> $loc.__init__ = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self) {<br />     self.stack = [];<br /> });<br /> <br /> $loc.push = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self,x) {<br />     self.stack.push(x);<br /> });<br /> $loc.pop = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self) {<br />     return self.stack.pop();<br /> });<br />    },<br />    'Stack', []);<br /><br /><br />    return mod;<br />}</pre><br />All modules start out with the $var builtinmodule = statement.<br />This test module exposes a single method to the outside world, called fact, There are a couple of key functions for building up a module. &nbsp;The Sk.builtin.func &nbsp; call for adding functions to your module, and the&nbsp;Sk.misceval.buildClass method. &nbsp;This test module defines a simple factorial function called fact, and a class called stack. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a simple Python program that exercises the module:<br /><pre>import bnm.test</pre><pre>print 'starting'</pre><pre>print bnm.test.fact(10)</pre><pre>x = bnm.test.Stack()</pre><pre>x.push(1)</pre><pre>x.push(2)</pre><pre>print x.pop()</pre><pre>print 'done'</pre><br />Its not obvious, but the buildClass method takes four parameters: &nbsp;globals, func, name, bases<br />It seems that you always pass the mod object itself as the globals parameter, the func parameter is a function that represents the class object, the Name is the external name of the class, and bases presumably would be if the class is inheriting from another class.<br />The Sk.builtin.func method creates a function. &nbsp;For module creation we typically only have to worry about the one parameter, func, which is the javascript implementation of our Python function. &nbsp;The method can also take a globals object and two closure objects. &nbsp;Look at the comments in function.js if you want more explanation of how the builtin.func method works.<br />Well, I think this should be enough to get you going. &nbsp;Its worth repeating, if you made it this far, don&#8217;t forget to call m docbi or m dist after you make changes in your module, its easy to get into the mode of thinking that the new javascript is automatically loaded. &nbsp;But builtin.js is not automatically rebuilt!<br />I&#8217;ll consider this post a work in progress, please leave a comment if something is unclear or you would like something explained in more detail.<br /><div

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been back in Decorah for less than 24 hours, its been a little more than 48 hours since we got off the cruise ship in Valparaiso.  It was great to get a good nights sleep last night after having an overnight flight from Santiago to Dallas.  Boy do I wish I could sleep on airplanes.</p><p>The Celebrity debarkation process was about as painless as you could make it. We woke up, showered and dressed, got some coffee at the Cova Cafe, checked our email one last time, and then walked off the ship.  Like Buenos Aires, the port in Valparaiso is not really designed for cruise ships, so we got off the ship and then took a bus through the containers to the actual terminal.   We found our luggage right away and realized that this process was so efficient we still had about 45 minutes to wait before our guide, Mac, from <a href="http://www.labicicletaverde.com/">La Bicicleta Verde</a> It was a little odd this morning because Chile was supposed to go off daylight savings time at the same time the US was supposed to go on daylight savings.  So, in one day we would go from being 3 hours ahead of home to just one hour.  Strangely the government of chile decided at the last minute not to go off daylight savings time, so some people were really off.  Mac showed up just after 9:00, and we got our tour underway.  We started by exploring the hills of Valparaiso.  Its an old shipping town, started when Nitrates were a big natural commodity that was shipped out of here.  Before the Canal, and before artificial nitrates had been invented.  So there are many beautiful old shipping houses owned by the british that have been converted into small hotels.  Here you can see one last view of our ship from the hills:</p><p><img title="IMG_2559.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lgbWQR_I/AAAAAAAAAPs/qYK_mU8OK4g/IMG_2559.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2559" width="400" height="266" /></p><p>We continued on past the first Lutheran Church in Valparaiso, and then had to avoid a pack of street dogs.  All chilean cities are full of street animals that are well feed and mostly well behaved.  The problem this morning was there was one female in heat and four males that were trying to get her attention.  Things got a little violent, so we headed off in the opposite direction hoping to lose the pack.</p><p>Mac told us that the day before this whole area of the city had been without power.  Now as you can see from this picture Valparaiso has a very modern system of electrical distribution:</p><p><img title="IMG_2566.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lhdhCiAI/AAAAAAAAAPw/T80lkZzXk3c/IMG_2566.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2566" width="400" height="266" /></p><p>We were told that whenever there is a power loss, rather than trying to untangle the mass of wires and fix the problem, they simply find an area of the city that has power and then run a new wire to the blacked out area from there.</p><p>After the hill tour we headed down the coastline to visit some of the beautiful coastal towns, suchas Vina del Mar.  This would be an awesome place to come back and visit on a land tour.  The beaches are spectacular, and there are some really awesome restaurants looking right out over the water.  Mac got us number one at the most popular restaurant along this stretch.  People literally line up outside this restaurant waiting for a table.  Something that is unheard of in Chile.  We started off with a couple of apetizers:  Machas ala parmesan (razor clams smothered in a parmesan cream sauce.)  The only way to sum up this dish is:  To Die For!  We also had Camerones pil pil (little shrimp scampi).  Then for the main course we had freshly prepared fish.  They have about 7 different kinds of fish on the menu, each one with several different preparations.  I had Albacora (swordfish) grilled, and Jane had the Corvina (chilean sea bass) also grilled.  We had a side of Arroz and thought we were in heaven.  What a great last meal of the trip.  Oh, lest I forget , I also had my first Pisco Sour.  Pisco Sour is a great chilean drink made of a distilled wine (kind of like brandy) served with lime juice and simple syrup.  Just one please!</p><p><img title="IMG_2569.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-liHkJ7eI/AAAAAAAAAP0/PeTTyYLJ17E/IMG_2569.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2569" width="400" height="266" /></p><p>After our delicious lunch we headed out to wine country.  The Casablanca valley is between Valparaiso and Santiago.  We stopped at the Emiliana Organic Vineyards, for a wine tasting and a walk around the vineyards.  We had a great wine steward, named Joshua, who served us samples of their premium Emiliana Adobe line.  This is sold in the United States under the Emiliana Natura label because of  a trademark dispute with the Adobe software company.  Please lawyers find something more productive to do with your time.  The highlight was their Gewurtztraminer, its not nearly as sweet as the German Gewurtztraminers and was very refreshing.  In addition to being organic they also practice Biodynamics (you&#8217;ll have to look it up).  This sounds like a lot of hokum to me, but you can&#8217;t argue with the results.</p><p><img title="IMG_2574.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-ljPq7YOI/AAAAAAAAAP4/6L6V9pT56Iw/IMG_2574.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2574" width="400" height="266" /></p><p>Finally, what trip would be complete without some cute animals.  The vineyard also raises Alpacas, which we learned are part of the Camel family.</p><p><img title="IMG_2585.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TX-lj20NJvI/AAAAAAAAAP8/DyB6X7faf6c/IMG_2585.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG 2585" width="400" height="266" /></p><p>With the vineyard tour over, our last stop was the Santiago airport.  We had lots of time to kill, since we got there about 5pm and our flight wasn&#8217;t supposed to leave until 10:05.  Of course at 5:00 the American Airlines counters were not even open yet. Then at 6:00 when they opened it was a mad house.  hundreds of tired cruisers all anxious to get home, and all accustomed to being pampered for two weeks were now forced to stand in extremely long lines like so many commoners.  It was not pretty.  An interesting thing about flying out of Santiago is that all the outgoing flights leave in the evening, this is partly because you want to time your flight to get in to the states at a decent hour of the morning.  Say 6:00 AM or so.  But all the incoming flights get in to Santiago at 7 or 8 in the morning anyway, so why not have an outbound flight at 10AM?  By Chilean law, all outbound flights must have a complete mechanical inspection within 12 hours of their flight by a Chilean mechanical team.  The reason for this law dates back to 1972 when the Uruguayan rugby team crashed in the Andes and resorted to cannibalism to stay alive.  The Chilean legislature wanted to ensure that nothing like this would ever happen again so they passed this inspection law.  The result is that the flights that leave in the evening are never delayed for mechanical reasons, because they&#8217;ve had all day to inspect and fix everything.  Nice, makes you feel safe.</p><p>Well, that brings us as far as our last flights, which were pretty uneventful.  A bit of turbulence somewhere between Santiago and Dallas is about the only thing worth mentioning.  This was an awesome trip.  Thanks again to all the great new friends we made on board the ship for making it a fun time!</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-570044920896128868?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
