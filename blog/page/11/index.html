  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why I&#8217;m writing this on a 27 in iMac</h2><br /><br />I&#8217;m almost lost as I stare at the screen to write this post.  27 inches is a lot of screen real estate to work with, but boy do I love this new iMac!  It is fast, fast, fast.  I never thought of my Macbook Pro as being a slow machine but this is crazy fast in comparison.  Typesetting my textbook project used to take minutes on the MBP, now it takes just a few seconds.  Why all this speed?  Maybe it is due to the 8 GB of memory and the 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 processor.<br /><br />The more interesting question is why am I replacing my MBP with an iMac?  The answer, in a word, is iPad.  After trying out my iPad for a few days back in April I was convinced that I would no longer need a notebook, and that my money would be better spent on a desktop.  After traveling in Europe for 28 days with the iPad as my only computer I am convinced I was right.  The iPad is the best computer ever for traveling.<br /><br /><h2>On the Plane</h2><br />Flying with an iPad is great.  We had a seven hour flight and I had loaded several movies and a bunch of TV show episodes onto my iPad, I&#8217;ve never had a more enjoyable long flight.  I can&#8217;t sleep on planes, so it was great to be able to watch two movies and a few episodes of Merlin on the flight over.  My Bose noise canceling headphones make the experience even better as they do such a great job of blocking out the jet noise.<br /><br />When I wasn&#8217;t watching a video I was reading.  I had several books loaded on both iBooks and Kindle apps.  I really wish there was more selection in the iBooks store, as I&#8217;m finding they rarely have the book I want, so the kindle app gets used more frequently.<br /><br />Finally, if I wasn&#8217;t watching or reading I had several games loaded to keep me entertained.  I like Scrabble, Strategery, and Fieldrunners the best, although I did play a few games of chess against tChess Lite.<br /><br /><h2>On the Ground</h2><br />While on the ground I found several apps to be incredibly useful.  WeatherBug is awesome for checking the weather forecast while away, its easy to add new cities and the coverage in the UK, Ireland, and Scandinavia is excellent. <br /><br />For keeping up with the daily technology news I really like Early Edition.  It is beautiful in that it takes away all the hassle of marking things as read or whatever, every day you just get a nice newspaper like layout of the new articles that have come in since yesterday.  I love how this keeps me from getting overwhelmed with stuff when I get a few days behind.  If someone comes out with an Early Edition like reader for the mac I&#8217;m almost sure that would replace my longtime favorite, NetNewsWire, on my desktop.<br /><br />Every day I also used the Photo app, it was so easy to transfer pictures from my Canon 7D to the iPad. After the transfer I could delete the really bad pictures right away, and it was great to be able to look at the photos I had taken on the iPad size screen rather than the little screen on the camera.  I really wish apple would make it possible to rate and organize pictures on the iPad that would make it even better.  Now that I&#8217;m home, I still have to go through the process of picking the best of the 1000 pictures I took and organizing them into an album.  If you could do that on the iPad then I could pick the best of each day as I go along.  I also bought PhotoForge for the iPad because there were a couple of times that I wanted to upload a photo to Facebook, and its impossible to edit the photos on Facebook using Safari on the iPad.  PhotoForge is great and very easy to use.<br /><br />The other app that got a lot of use was Evernote.  prior to leaving my wife had prepared notes for each day of the trip, along with pdf maps and other info about each destination.  Although she had saved them as notes in our shared Dropbox account I found it to be much easier to drag them all into Evernote rather than the hassle of marking each document as a favorite in Dropbox so I could have offline access.  I really wish Dropbox would improve the iPad and iPhone clients to make it easier to keep things available offline.<br /><br />Finally, I wrote a blog entry almost every day of the trip using BlogPress.  I purchased an Apple Bluetooth keyboard for writing purposes and I really love it for writing longer blog entries.  For Facebook and email the onscreen keyboard is fine, but for longer writing the keyboard was awesome, and it proved to be very durable and easy to carry along in my daypack.  BlogPress itself worked like a champ.  It was a breeze to choose pictures from the Photo app to drop into the blog, and it also worked very well offline.  A lot of times I would write the blog entry when I wasn&#8217;t in wi-fi range and then just post it when I found some free wi-fi.  I also like how BlogPress makes it easy to make a Facebook posting every time I publish a blog entry.  That was a great way for friends and family to know there was something new to read.<br /><br />Incidentally I did not find myself wishing for a 3G iPad at all.  I was always able to find some kind of wi-fi no matter where we were.  Every hotel we stayed in had wi-fi available, not always free, but I would say in 90% of the hotels it was free.  If it wasn&#8217;t free in the hotel it was not too hard to find a pub or restaurant nearby that did have it available, for the price of a coffee or drink.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2083102877647968900?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&#8230;  This morning the sky was mostly cloudy, and there was almost no wind.  So I went along with Dan, Brian, James, and Joanna to do the mast ride.  This was an optional 8 mile ride for the before breakfast crowd.  The main feature of this ride was an 840 (Padraic said 250, but the GPS showed the lie) foot climb.  Most of that 840 feet was in the last 3/4 of a mile.  For those of you from Decorah just imagine the First Lutheran hill extended to 3/4 of a mile.<br /><br />The view from the mast was fantastic, we could see the ocean and a couple of beautiful lakes.  The hill was so steep, and the roads were just a little bit damp, that I actually had to walk my bike the last 100 yards, because I could not get enough traction when I was sitting on the bike and pedaling!  The ride down was almost as exciting, in fact it seemed quite a bit more dangerous than the ride up as it was difficult to keep your speed down without skidding all over the place.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/64.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_64.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />After finishing that ride I was very ready for my breakfast back at Rosleague Manor.  I had a ham and cheese omelet with some of the best croissants ever.  To wash down the omelet I had a glass of grapefruit juice and a cup of black coffee.  The manor employs a great French chef, and they have an exchange program to bring over young people from france to learn Irish service customs.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/65.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_65.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />After breakfast there was another optional ride.  From Rosleague we rode to Letterfrack, then out on the Connemara loop, past Molly the pirate queen&#8217;s castle, and then on to Renvyle, Tulley, Tulley Cross, and then back to Letterfrack by a different road.  Once again we had fantastic views, we saw a small vertical wind turbine, and learned about Grace O&#8217;Malley the pirate queen.  Back in the 1500&#8217;s she was a very powerful woman who enjoyed plundering the english royal ships that were in turn plundering all of Ireland.  She and queen Elizabeth met to try and resolve the issue but as long as Elizabeth was unwilling to stop plundering Ireland, Grace O&#8217;Malley was unwilling to stop sinking and plundering their ships.  Apparently they ended up agreeing to disagree, but I&#8217;m sure it was an exciting meeting.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/66.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_66.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />We met up with the rest of the group in Letterfrack for lunch at Currachs.  Although three courses were offered as part of lunch most of us could not imagine eating more than one course and maybe a bit of dessert.  Many of us had the Irish pizza and it was quite good.  A nice change from the last couple of days.  I also had a chocolate chip cookie for desert which was excellent but a bad choice as the chocolate muffin was clearly superior.  Kaia had snicker bar pie which would have been a close second or third I&#8217;m sure.  Jane and Josh had apple pie and ice cream.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s where the story of the day takes a turn for the worse.  Just as we were finishing up, the weather forecast for the day came true.  Rain after noon.  We rode to the Kylmore Abbey in a torrential rain.  At one point we came out from behind a wind break and I was nearly stopped in my tracks by the strength of the wind.  My little water resistant biking wind breaker was doing nothing to stop this rain and I was wet and chilled by the time we got to the Abbey.  The Abbey was pretty impressive in the oppressive weather, and I&#8217;m sure it would have been brilliant in good weather.<br /><br />After the Abbey I seriously considered buying a new waterproof winter coat, but instead I borrowed one of Padriac&#8217;s extra rain jackets.  We had 17 additional miles to get to Ballynahinch (pronounced like bal-in-the-hinch if you say it really fast) Castle.  After a half a mile we were all soaked through completely, my shoes were completely soaked, my pants were soaked, all of my layers were soaked.  And the headwind was horrific.  After a while we realized that there was no possible way we could get any wetter, so we might just as well accept our fate and enjoy the ride.  Once again, I&#8217;m sure that in reasonable weather it would have been beautiful.  As it was I was still nice.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/67.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_67.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Now we are at the castle, showered, dried, and warm.  Our clothes have been sent off to be dried, and the porter will collect our shoes to leave them in the boiler room to dry over night.  All is well, as DuVine takes good care of us.  Our only remaining decision for the day is whether to stay here at the castle and eat at the pub or to go into town and try one of the restaurants there.<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Ballynahinch%20castle&z=10'>Ballynahinch castle</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8838488372752005579?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Well, today is our last official day of vacation.  Tomorrow is a day of travel back to Dublin and then we wake up and head to the airport to see Kaia off to France and the rest of us to Chicago.<br /><br />After our rain soaked day yesterday we were thrilled to wake up to see the sun and big puffy white clouds today. What a difference the sun makes!  Our departure this morning was slightly delayed as we were still drying shoes and clothing from yesterday, and (I suspect) because most of the group was in Roundstone partying at the pub until late last night.  The Miller family stayed and had dinner at the castle last night as we are all showing the wear of nearly four weeks on the road.  <br /><br />I can&#8217;t imagine what the maid must have though when she came into our room this morning.  I had been sitting on the floor drying 3 pairs of shoes with the blow drier; the shoes I&#8217;ve worn every day for the last 3 weeks, Josh&#8217;s tennis shoes, and Jane&#8217;s walking shoes.  The smell was indescribable.<br /><br />When we did take off we headed out toward Roundstone, a beautiful little seaside village which is becoming very popular among the well to do here in Ireland.  When you come into town you go right past the house of the guy who wrote the original River Dance. From Roundstone we made our way along the coast toward Ballyconeely where we had our first &#8216;table stop&#8217; of the day. Padraic was busy setting out a table with fruit and granola bars and juice for us.  <br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1061.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1061.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />We only had a little further to go to get to Clifden, so we decided to do the Sky Drive loop before lunch rather than after.  That turned out to be a great decision as the weather cooperated perfectly and we were treated to magnificent views of the sea.  Based on the color of the sea you would think that you were in the Caribbean not Ireland!  As you might guess the Sky drive was a bit of a climb but it takes you right out to a point where you can see ocean in three different directions. Here&#8217;s the Miller family at our stop on the point.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1062.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1062.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Of course by this time our guides had already schemed to set up another table stop.  They had gone to the store in Clifden and bought some more Bulmers cider, this was the new berry flavor that Padraic had not had before so he was even more excited than usual for us to give it a try.  We toasted a great trip and all of our new found friends.<br /><br />The ride back into Clifden was mostly downhill, but by this time we really were ready for some food.  We ate at E.J. Kings pub, Jane and I had the chicken curry, Kaia had ravioli, and Josh had a club sandwich.  I think Padraic was a little disappointed that we had strayed from traditional irish fare but by this time our palate&#8217;s were ready for something a little more spicy.  We all had to laugh at Josh during lunch because we were talking about the weather and how lucky we were that it wasn&#8217;t raining like it was yesterday.  I said yes, it only rains in Ireland on days that contain a &#8216;y.&#8217;  Jane and Kaia laughed and the conversation moved on.  Suddenly, from out of the blue, Josh says, &#8220;wait every day has a &#8216;y&#8217; in it.&#8221;  We still love him.  <br /><br />By the time we finished lunch it was almost 3:00 and it was time to head back to the Castle.  The Miller family took off a little ahead of the pack, and then Josh and I separated from Jane and Kaia, we made it back in record time.  It was our flattest ride yet.  The interesting thing about riding through the bog is how similar it looks to the prairies of Southern Minnesota, except where the glaciers flattened all the granite in Minnesota there were no glaciers here so the granite still stands in small hills and big chunks of rock sticking up out of the landscape.<br /><br />Josh and I were so fast  that I missed the last table stop.  A little bit of Jameson Irish Whiskey to toast our final ride.  Not being a whiskey fan, that did not hurt my feelings except that Padraic insisted on pouring me a glass in the parking lot of the Castle when he caught up to us.  <br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1063.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1063.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Tonight we have our final group meal in the main dining room here at the castle.  Based on the look I had at the menu last night it will be a feast.  This has really been a great way to finish up our vacation.  The people in our group have been a lot of fun, and DuVine really lives up to their motto, Bike, Eat, Drink, Sleep.  In the photo above we have in the front row, Dan, Craig, Kaia, Laurie, and Joanna.  In the back row we have Patty (Dan&#8217;s wife) Bobby and Brian, Brad and Jane, Josh, and James (Joanna&#8217;s fiance)<br /><br />Not in the picture are our two amazing guides for the week Padraic and Kirk.  These guys are amazing and made for a really fun week.  Its easy to forget that every time we were having fun and sitting around enjoying ourselves they were tending to every minute detail to make sure that our trip was a success.<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Ballynahinch%20Castle&z=10'>Ballynahinch Castle</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8969336433699357685?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">We are staying in a castle!  Ashford castle to be precise.  It&#8217;s about an hour outside of Galway and it&#8217;s absolutely beautiful.  We arrived yesterday afternoon with our DuVine Adventures guides Kirk and Padraic.  Yesterday was mostly about checking to the room, getting our bikes fit, and getting to know our fellow cyclists.  There are a total of 12 of us on the trip and everyone is really nice.  There are no other young adults on the trip but so far everyone has been very welcoming of Josh and Kaia.<br /><br />This morning we woke up to what the irish call a soft rain, we might call it a mist but I like the irish term better.  It really is so soft that you forget about the precipitation until you are totally soaked by it.  We had a nice breakfast here at the castle and then Josh and I went golfing at the nine hole course, and Jane went along with some of our fellow cyclists to a falconry class.  It was amazing, they got to wear the leather glove, and the falcon would take off and land from their arm.  Meanwhile Josh and I were sharing a set of clubs and getting soaked while playing some golf in Ireland.  The course was not too hard, and on the par three I almost got a legitimate hole in one, see my previous post on St. Andrews!<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/0.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />At noon we took off on our first true ride of the tour.  We cycled up the road a bit to stop for lunch in a small pub.  The only problem was that the soft rain had not abated, and according to our head waiter at the castle, &#8220;If its still raining at 11, its probably going to keep raining all day.&#8221;  It really was a soft rain and although we were all quite wet at our lunch stop we dried out rather quickly as well.  Our destination for the afternoon was Joyce Country Sheepdogs.  Here we Met Joe Joyce who is a sheep farmer and breeder of working dogs.  If you have seen Marley and Me, you have seen Joe&#8217;s sheep and one of his dogs (not Marley &#8211; Its the scene where the sheep are blocking the road)<br /><br />Joe showed us how the dogs herd the sheep and how they respond to his verbal or whistled commands.  He lives in a beautiful stone house, and his sheep roam the mountains across the lake from his home.  When he needs to bring the sheep in for something, which happens five times a year, he brings his dogs across the lake and he commands them using his whistle from a boat where he has a better view.  These dogs are amazing, they WANT to work so hard for him they go crazy when its not their turn to herd the sheep.  I should say it rained on us the last couple of miles to Joe&#8217;s house so we were all like drowned rats when we got their.  Thankfully while we were there the rain let up and the sun started to break through.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/2.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_2.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />The ride back was even more beautiful than the ride out, thanks in large part to the lack of rain.  Its amazing how green and beautiful the Irish countryside is.  The mountains go directly down to the lake shore and the lakes themselves are incredibly beautiful.  Tonight we had our second amazing dinner at the castle, this dinner was much less formal than last night&#8217;s sport coat and tie affair, but my seafood chowder was to die for, the fish and chips were good, and then the desert, a white chocolate rhubarb tart was amazing.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/3.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_3.jpg' border='0' width='210' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Tomorrow we have about 40 miles to bike to our next destination and another delicious dinner, I&#8217;m already looking forward to it, and I hope we will have sun all day tomorrow.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4754161074077029100?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">We woke up this morning in Ashford Castle to a clear blue sky.  After a breakfast, we were left our luggage outside our door and loaded our backpacks into the van.  We were on our way for 40 miles of cycling at 9:00 this morning.  We only rode about a half a mile before we made our first stop at the Ashford Abbey.  This is a very well preserved Abbey.  We learned that the most well preserved churches are from the church of Ireland, since in times past there were many interesting rules applied to the catholics.  For example if you were catholic you could only build your church out of wood.  If you were catholic you could not pass down your family land to one member of the family it had to be divided equally among all of the family members.  So for a large catholic family it did not take many generations before the land was subdivided into sections so small that they were useless for farming.  While we were at the Abbey reading gravestones,  I did discover a typo on one from the 1800&#8217;s  the stone read that the couple buried was survived by &#8220;there&#8221; daughter.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1060.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1060.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Biking with DuVine is a bit different from the way I bike at home.  When I bike at home I just ride and I keep riding until I&#8217;m done.  With DuVine we ride, then we stop for snacks.  These snacks always involve an important local beverage.  We&#8217;ve tried some delicious Irish Stouts, a Smithwicks Ale, along with a some wonderful Bulmers Cider.   Anyway, as I was saying, the weather today was fantastic, no wind, and some great sun.  Here&#8217;s a picture of Loch Fuehy (lake phooey) You could really see the reflection of the hills in the water it was so still.  <br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1061.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1061.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Our first snack stop today was at the edge of Irelands only Fjord.  Does anyone know what it takes for a body of water to be a fjord?  Mike keep your hand down, anyone else?  No, well to be a fjord, you must be fed by the Ocean, and must be formed by a glacier.  For our stop we had some Bulmers pear cider (I hope someone in Decorah can get this) and some fruit.  After a little rest we continued up the road to our lunch stop.  We had a specially designed menu just for us.  I had some seafood chowder, a crab sandwich (right fresh from the fjord) and some Creme Brule for desert.  Below you can see a picture of the fjord.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1062.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1062.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />We had one pretty good climb today, just before our lunch break.  Jane had a little problem with her chain at the bottom of the climb and ended up talking with one of the local farmers for quite some time before she got a ride in the van to our lunch stop.<br /><br />Another fun feature of riding in Ireland is that occasionally some sheep will be right on the road.  Here you can see Jane herding a small flock out of our way.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/1063.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/29/s_1063.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />After our lunch we continued along the fjord until we turned onto the coast.  We stopped to check out the peat bogs, and have a little afternoon snack of some Harps Lager and nuts.  Once again the views were just amazing.  Now we are at Roseleague Manor.  There were a lot of rolling hills today so we are just chilling, catching up and email and blogging until our next meal.  when DuVine says their motto is &#8220;Bike, Eat, Drink, Sleep&#8221; they really are not kidding.  We&#8217;ve had fantastic food everywhere so far, and I feel like every calorie I bike off, I immediately consume at the next snack stop.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2131677003684979934?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">The other night on our pub crawl, Eugene told us a story about the Irish people and how they would conquer the world.  He started with the excuse that Ireland has been invaded by just about everyone else on the planet, and how Ireland has a hopeless military;  but went on to describe their master plan.  According to Eugene when you go into a bar in Ireland you are likely to be ignored for a while, but if you stick around eventually someone will come up and start talking to you.  This is not because they are especially friendly, but because the are especially nosey.  &#8220;Within 15 minutes they will have your name, your parents names, your grandparents names, and your home address.&#8221;  This information is useful he says because sometime in the future, when you least expect it &#8220;this person will show up on your door with a sleeping bag in hand.&#8221;  They&#8217;ll find a quite place to settle down and sometime later fifteen of them will emerge!  And this is how Ireland will conquer the world.  We all laughed.<br /><br />Last night at Fagan&#8217;s pub we experienced part one of this scenario.  We were watching the USA versus Ghana match having a nice time, enjoying a pint and some appetizers, and being cheerfully ignored by all the locals. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned around awkwardly to find a red-haired man in a gold and green striped jersey wishing the USA good luck. He wanted to know if we were on holiday here in Ireland? If we were football fans? How long we were staying?  What we were doing in Galway? What was our surname?  Where were we from?  (city and state)  As this very friendly irishman took a break of his inquisition to get another pint, Josh leaned over to me and said &#8220;Dad he&#8217;s going to show up on our door with his sleeping bag!&#8221;  I just about fell on the floor laughing!  <br /><br />Partway through the second half the whole scenario repeated itself with two different guys.  It was all great fun, especially when Donovan tied up the score on his PK and the whole pub was cheering.  Sadly that all came to an end early on in the overtime period when our world cup hopes for USA were dashed.  Now we are left to wonder who to cheer for and whether our enthusiasm for watching world cup will wane after this defeat.  We have watched a lot of football on this trip, its been a fun constant for us in a sea of daily change.  Its forced us to sit down and relax at 4:00 or 8:30 most days rather than continuing to tour and walk.  Its revived my taste for a good pint of beer.<br /><br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Galway,%20Ireland&z=10'>Galway, Ireland</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8554259399871208957?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">This morning we are on the train from Dublin to Galway.  We woke up to a bright blue sky in Dublin, packed up our belongings, and left our little apartment for the tram to the train station.  Although the apartment itself was a bit sketchy it was in a great neighborhood and we had wonderful restaurants up and down the block.<br /><br />Last night we had a wonderful Thai meal at Koh.  We shared three appetizers and three main course dishes.  For the appetizers we had mixed satays, vietnamese beef balls, and ceviche.  All were delicious.  For the main course we shared green curry with chicken, cashew chicken, and panang curry with beef.  I think we each had our own favorite it was all so good.<br /><br />Yesterday was definitely a full day of touristing in Dublin.  We started off our day on the hop-on-hop-off tour bus.  Our first hop-off was at the Guinness storehouse.  This is a building that Guinness has turned into a monument to all things Guinness.  The building is designed so that your tour takes you around and around and on a spiral upward around the worlds largest Guinness pint glass.  We learned about how Guinness is brewed, about the history of Guinness, and how to pour the perfect pint of Guinness.  At the Gravity bar at the very top of the pint glass we were in an all glass circular room with great views of Dublin, there we could trade our ticket for&#8230;.. A pint of Guinness!  Here&#8217;s Josh and I in front of the waterfall&#8230;good pure water is key to making Guinness.  Mr Guiness signed a 9000 year lease for the land on which the brewery sits in part because of it&#8217;s access to the pure water flowing in from the Dublin Mountains.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/731.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/s_731.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />After the Guinness tour we hopped back on the bus and headed for the Gaol. By this time we were very hungry and so we decided to find a bit of lunch.  There was not much to choose from in the area around the Gaol but Dolce Vita caught our attention almost right away.  We had some very nice pizzas and Kaia had a steaming hot bowl of Spaghetti Carbonara.<br /><br />The Kilmainham Gaol is a famous site in Dublin as it is the place where 14 of the 16 leaders of the Easter rebellion were executed.  It is a very old gaol and the history goes back well before the time of the potato famine in Ireland.  It was during the famine that the overcrowding at the gaol was at its worst.  The gaol has been featured in several movies including Michael Connelly, and the original version of The Italian Job.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/732.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/s_732.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />By the time we had finished our guided tour of the gaol our feet were tired so we hopped back on the bus and rode it all the way around to where we had started.  Along the way we saw lots of other sites of Dublin.  The hop-on-hop-off busses are all double decker busses with open tops so we sat up top and enjoyed the scenery.<br /><br />We returned to our apartment for a little break and decided to head out to find a pub with internet access.  We chose the Church bar, which is a bar/restaurant that has emerged from the remodeled Saint Mary&#8217;s church in Dublin.  This is the first bar I&#8217;ve been in that has its own pipe organ!  The pipe organ, built in the 18th century was used by G. F. Handel.  In addition there are several famous people who are buried in the church/pub, and there have been some important weddings including Alfred Guinness.  How appropriate to have a pint of Guinness in the place where he was married.<br /><br />After happy hour and then dinner at Koh we were all ready to just kick back and watch the world cup match in our apartment while we finished up washing all of our clothes.  The match between Chile and Spain was a yawner, as chile seemed to be willing to place their hopes on Switzerland playing to a draw.  Its been very interesting traveling to all of the different companies during the world cup competition.  We have seen lots of different kinds of coverage and commentators.  Last night on Irish TV there were four  very old guys who spent forever dissecting the match and making the case that Spain was really going to have to pick up their game if they had any hope of progressing during the elimination round.<br /><br />Today is a pretty light day.  We&#8217;ll get in to Galway just after noon, and we don&#8217;t have much planned other than some light walking around and scoping out somewhere to watch USA play tonight.  Josh and I are both wearing our USA jerseys today.  Good Luck team USA.<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=On%20the%20train%20from%20Dublin%20to%20Galway&z=10'>On the train from Dublin to Galway</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6269981965266059478?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Well last night a bit of Dublin had a taste of some Jim Croce music.  I&#8217;m not sure where it came from but we were enjoying the musical pub crawl that started in Tower Square.  Our two guides for the night were Eugene, who played the Irish banjo, and Steve who was a guitar player.  After a couple of pubs and a lot of good Irish Jigs and Reels, and some history of Irish music and instruments were were walking between pubs and I started up a conversation with Steve.  Steve also plays a Taylor guitar and it is the same model I have at home.  That was the kiss of death.  &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asks Eugene.  Brad, I say.  &#8220;Now we&#8217;ve got you&#8221; says Eugene, at this next stop you&#8217;ll have to play a little for us.  Uh, I don&#8217;t think thats a very good idea I said.  We talk a little more about what kind of music I like to play and where we are visiting in Ireland and where we have already been.  Steve mentions that he is a fan of Prairie Home Companion and how some of the things that Keillor talks about on the show remind him of Ireland and I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m safe and the whole sing for us thing was simply a fun idle threat.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/25/206.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/25/s_206.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />After we get to the next pub and the duo works through a couple more songs Eugene starts in on a long story about how its an Irish tradition to join in on a session and it doesn&#8217;t matter how good you are or if you even just sing one verse or whatever, its all in good fun.  The next thing I know Steve is handing me the Taylor and a pick I&#8217;m I&#8217;m thinking what the heck am I going to play!?  Roller Derby Queen is Jane&#8217;s suggestion and I think I can probably remember the chords and the words, so I start to strum a little bit to see if I can recall the right chords and pretty soon I&#8217;m singing.  I make it through a couple of versus without too many mistakes and finish up to the applause of the rest of the pub crawlers. Thankfully they all had had a few pints of Guinness by now so they were not an overly discriminating audience.  Anyway, it was great fun.<br /><br />So now that its the next morning and I&#8217;m thinking about it, I realize that I really have quite an international performance background.  I&#8217;ve played in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa.  I&#8217;ve played with a group of Tahitians sitting in a plastic lawn chair in the South Seas. And now I&#8217;ve played on an Irish pub crawl in Dublin.  It makes me wonder where I could go if I practiced some more!<br /><br />After the pub crawl was over, we found a little Italian place that was still serving pasta at 10:30 at night and finished off our first day in Dublin.  The day had started out very early, in Stockholm with a train ride to the Arlanda airport.  We flew SAS from Stockholm to Dublin and then took a bus from the airport to the city center of Dublin.  Here in Dublin we are staying in one of the StayDublin.com apartments.   Its a bit sketchy and in need of paint and a good cleaning but the apartment has two bedrooms a living room a kitchen with one of those funky european washer/dryer units.  If anyone can tell me out to operate one of those things properly please send me an email.  We cannot get the dryer to work for anything. <br /><br />After unloading our stuff at the apartment we started to explore the area a little.  We found a restaurant called Boojum, right by our apartment that is operated by a man from Philadelphia.  If you are looking for your fix of Chipotle right here in the heart of Dublin then Boojum is for you.  It was a nice lunch, and I think Josh was really happy with the food.  We took a tour of Trinity College and saw the Book of Kells.  This is an amazingly old illuminated version of the four gospels that has been preserved by the Trinity library, its a really interesting exhibit, and we had a great guide who is a student at Trinity and works for Ark.com, Ark sells clothing and the idea is that every time you wear an article of Ark clothing you perform An Act of Random Kindness.  Thats where the Ark name comes from.  The library at Trinity was also extremely interesting to me for two reasons.  First it is the largest single room library in Europe.  Its just beautiful to see books and bookshelves stretched out for a city block.  But the second reason is interesting to my twisted computer science mind because of how the books are organized in the library.  The books are sorted by SIZE!  In order to find a book in this library you must know the exact dimensions of the book to get you to the proper shelf!<br /><br />After the tour of Trinity we just walked around and enjoyed the street performers and the shops of Dublin.  Josh wanted to go to the Leprechaun museum but he was out voted 3 to 1.  So we went back to the apartment to rest our feet and find an internet cafe to catch up on email and Facebook before the pub crawl.  Today we are doing a hop-on-hop-off tour of the city and plan to take the tour of the Guiness Brewery and the Dublin Gaol.<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Dublin,%20Ireland&z=10'>Dublin, Ireland</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4716558466489004136?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Today we heard the name Gustavus Adophus quite a lot.  With apologies to my friends in St. Peter I must say he didn&#8217;t know much about ship building.  In all truth it really wasn&#8217;t his fault from a technical point of view, but he did pay the bill.  I am talking about the Vasa of course.  It is the largest ship to be recovered and salvaged and conserved in a museum.  This is definitely a must see sight if you go to Stockholm.  The Vasa was built in 1628 and was the largest ship in the Swedish fleet.  Unfortunately she sunk on her maiden voyage out of the harbor!  The reason she sank was because there was not enough ballast in the ship to counterbalance the forces on the sails in the heavy breeze.  This seems like an incredibly dumb mistake for a ship builder to make, but there you have it.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1331.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1331.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />The ship lay submerged for 333 years until an amazing recovery operation in the 1960&#8217;s brought the ship to the surface.  The Vasa is amazingly well preserved due to the water conditions in the Baltic.   The museum is just as interesting for the story of how the ship was raised to the surface and preserved as it was to learn about the building of the ship in 1628.<br /><br />The Vasa Museum was our first stop today in Stockholm.  Our day started early as we had to debark from the vision of the seas by 7:40.  The sailing in to Stockholm was once again beautiful and very reminiscent of Wisconsin and Northern Minnesota.  We are all very lonely for our cabin at the sight of water, boats, rave trampolines and all the pine trees.  The rest of the morning we wandered around stockholm enjoying the shops and the old town.  We did a little shopping.  I got an official USA soccer jersey to wear for the game today.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1332.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1332.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />After walking around all morning we returned to our hotel to check in and rest up a bit.  We are staying in the Rica Hotel on Gamla Stan in a wonderful part of stockholm.  The streets around here are narrow and cobbled and there are restaurants and bars and little shops everywhere.  We hunted around a little bit to decide where to have a late afternoon dinner and watch the USA versus Algeria match.  We found O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s, a boston themed restaurant owned by a swede who spent time in Boston.  They had the England match on upstairs and the USA match on down.  The American fans were many and much louder than the brits.  In a funny small world moment I recognized one of the other fans in the restaurant as the same person we had watched football with when we were in Balestrand!  They were originally from Minnesota but had moved to Boston.<br /><br />To catch up on our activities, yesterday we were in Tallin Estonia, and the day before was a day at sea.  Tallin was a really nice city, it has the oldest medieval walled city in Europe.  The city reminded us a little of Italy and of some of the walled cities we had visited in Tuscany.  The city is an interesting mix of scandinavian and Russian influences.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1333.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1333.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/1334.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/23/s_1334.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Jane had a walking tour of the city that we got on the internet and we followed that plan around the city for several hours.  After that we returned to the ship for our last night on board.<br /><br />We are having a great time, but we are all very tired today.  We just didn&#8217;t have a lot of energy for many touring activities.  And the USA victory took a lot of energy as well.  Early to bed tonight, but up again early tomorrow morning for our flight to Dublin.<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Stockholm,%20Sweden&z=10'>Stockholm, Sweden</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1679743920454965479?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">After days and days of using our feet to get around european cities it was time for a change, and what better city to try two wheeled touring in than Copenhagen.  Copenhagen has more bikes than anywhere else in the world.  They make the people of Portland look like a bunch of slackers.  There are literally bikes everywhere.  At the train stations there are bike racks two stories high, there are bike racks everywhere and people riding their bikes everywhere.  <br /><br />Jane found Biking with Mike on the internet, he is a lifelong resident of Copenhagen who left his job as a director at a large company to do what he loves &#8211; bike and tell people about his city.  There is no fancy signup procedure as each days tours are first come first served.  If the weather is horrible there won&#8217;t be a tour.  <br /><br />We left the ship at 9:30 and headed straight for Mike&#8217;s bike shop.  We knew the tour was not until 10:30 but we wanted to make sure we got a spot on the tour.  We arrived by taxi 5 minutes later, but the shop did not even open until 10:00.  So we walked around the area a little bit and decided to get a coffee at the cafe up the block from Mike&#8217;s.  One minor problem was that we hadn&#8217;t taken the time to find a cash machine and get some Danish Kroners.  After preparing our coffee we discovered that the credit card reader in the coffee shop was not working properly, and so we were unable to pay.  In Decorah, this would not really be a problem, go find some money and pay me later.  Who would have guessed that we would find the same attitude in a big city?  This appears to be the Danish way.  The proprietor of the coffee shop was perfectly happy to have us go on our bike tour, get some cash, and pay him later in the day.<br /><br />Shortly after 10 Mike arrived.  Bright green stocking hat, bright green shoes, a yellow and black livestrong vest and fashionable glasses.  His bike matched his cycling outfit.  Mike took us on a tour for a little over 3 hours.  We saw the palace, the castle, the parliament buildings, the house where Hans Christian Anderson was born, the new opera house, a couple of parks, and a little lawless place called Christiana.  We would bike for a while and then stop and mike would give us a short lecture on what were were looking at, Danish politics, Danish culture, local gossip, you name it and MIke knew about it.  He is an excellent story teller.  As we were riding there was no talking, the idea is to absorb the local feeling of the place as you are riding rather than chatting.  It worked.  It was fun, we saw a lot of the city.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/439.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_439.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Christiana was the most interesting stop on the tour.  We had coffee in the moonshine cafe.  It is the safest coffee house in Copenhagen. Why?  The sign on the door tells the story.  More than 6000 police inspections since 2004.  Christiana is the counter culture area of Copenhagen, Mike discouraged us from taking any pictures in the area because you never know when you might accidentally capture a deal going down, and they don&#8217;t like that.<br /><br />We learned one word of Danish that really sums up our Copenhagen experience.  The word is Hygglite, it is difficult to describe exactly what it means, cozy is one possible translation while fantastic is another.  Internet people might translate it as &#8220;A Good Thing.&#8221;  Its a word they use in Denmark to describe when something is just right and good.  Our bike tour of Copenhagen with mike was definitely Hygglite.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/440.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_440.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />At the conclusion of our tour we paid mike and headed, on foot, back through the park on the way to the ship.  When we emerged from the park, there was Mike on his bike.  Hello he said, I wonder if you might have a few minute to talk to a reporter from the paper Politik?  Its the largest Danish paper and they are doing a story about touring copenhagen on bike.  It seems that the reporter for the paper was planning to go on Mike&#8217;s afternoon tour, but because of the oncoming rain Mike had cancelled the afternoon tour.  So, we agreed to spend a few minutes talking to the reporter and then we got our picture taken by one of the photographers from the paper.  So, if you speak Danish you can read about the Miller family and our bike fun in the city of Copenhagen!<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Copenhagen,%20Denmark&z=10'>Copenhagen, Denmark</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2200921901605184937?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
