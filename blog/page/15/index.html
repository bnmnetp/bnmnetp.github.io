  <div class="entry-content"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While waiting for the white smoke to emerge on Textmate 2.0, I decidedto revisit an old friend.  It turns out the emacsen have been busysince I&#8217;ve been using TextMate.  Aquamacs 2.0 is a great Cocoa port ofEmacs 23.  Not sure whether I should call it a port since emacsofficially supports the OS X operating system.The first thing I did was check out some of the old modes I used touse.  AucTeX, GNUs are both packaged with emacs now.   The SQL mode that comes withis great and &#8220;just works&#8221; with mysql and postgresql. There is goodsupport for Python and of course HTML. Two minor gliches in thoseareas that I wish I could fix:<ul><li>I cannot get MMM (multi-major-mode) to work properly.  I wouldreally like to have both HTML and Javascript colorized properly whenI&#8217;m working on my Django projects.  If anyone has any advice ongetting MMM to work right in emacs 23 I would really appreciate apointer.</li><li>Completion in iPython does not work right.  Instead of completingin the ipython shell it just indents more.</li></ul>In addition to some old friends I discovered a bunch of new modes thatare really nice.  JDE for Java development, Muse for creating lecturenotes in a personal wiki style.  In addition Muse lets you publish amarkup style format really easily in lots of differnt output formats.I&#8217;ve been a big fan of using Pandoc with TextMate over the last fewyears, but Muse is every bit as nice.One thing lacking in Muse was the ability to quickly bold or ital ortt some part of the text I&#8217;m working on.  So I decided to dust off mylisp coding ability and cook up my own.  The result is shown below.  Ithink it is a nice example of a lot of what you need to do in writingbasic lisp extensions for any text processing mode.  I&#8217;d be happy toget comments on how to improve this.The idea of these simple commands is that pressing cmd-b should boldthe word the cursor is currently on, or the region (if there is one)or simply insert **|** when the cursor is not on a word.   It alsotook some research to figure out how to bind a function to the commandkey. (side note: I&#8217;ve finally gotten comfortable with using the optionkey for meta in emacs.)<br /><br /><pre style="overflow:auto;" class="prettyprint lang-el"><br />(defun muse-bold-word ()<br />  (interactive)<br />  (muse-wrap-with-string "**" 2)<br />)<br /><br />(defun muse-ital-word ()<br />  (interactive)<br />  (muse-wrap-with-string "*" 1)<br />)<br /><br />(defun muse-tt-word () <br />  (interactive)<br />  (muse-wrap-with-string "=" 1)<br />)<br /><br />(defun muse-wrap-with-string (str len)<br />  (if mark-active<br />      (progn<br /> (kill-region (point) (mark))<br /> (let ((myword (car kill-ring)))<br />   (insert (concat str myword str) )))<br />    (let ((myStr (thing-at-point 'word)))<br />      (if myStr<br />   (let ((myBounds (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'word)))<br />     (kill-region (car myBounds) (cdr myBounds))<br />     (insert (concat str myStr str)))<br /> (progn<br />   (insert (concat str str))<br />   (goto-char (- (point) len)) ) ) ))<br />)<br /><br />(define-key muse-mode-map `[(,osxkeys-command-key b)] 'muse-bold-word)<br />(define-key muse-mode-map `[(,osxkeys-command-key i)] 'muse-ital-word)<br />(define-key muse-mode-map `[(,osxkeys-command-key k)] 'muse-tt-word)<br /><br /></pre>    </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7610258374161196053?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">After all of our hiking and rafting adventure we are ending the trip with 3 days of rest and relaxation in Sedona.  Our major activities here are a Pink Jeep tour, Golfing, and a massage for the women in the family.  Otherwise we are doing lots of pool time and have even played a hand or two of 500.  Sedona is known for its red rock and beautiful scenery, along with crystal shops and the Ye Olde UFO Shoppe.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq8nbha5xI/AAAAAAAAAFM/7G1088HYM5k/IMG_8141.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8141.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />We did the Broken Arrow tour with Pink Jeep, which was fun.  I think we would have appreciated it even more if we had not already done all the hiking through Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon.   Nevertheless it was a good excursion.  While we were out there the kids decided to do some rock climbing.  Don&#8217;t let the pictures fool you this was dangerous stuff:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq9EcmQuZI/AAAAAAAAAFU/OQaWwLBIbPc/IMG_8147.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8147.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Siq9a6hsYfI/AAAAAAAAAFY/I2n5d7fJrVE/IMG_8151.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8151.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />This morning Josh and I played a round of golf at the Sedona Country Club which is part of the Hilton complex.  It was a very nice course and Josh and I both played well.  It was a great morning to go as there was nobody in front of us and we were able to play at our own pace and move around the course pretty quickly.<br /><br />Josh got a new shirt and hat out of the deal as the club had a dress code and Josh did not have any clean shirts that would get him on the tee.  I played so well that I had to buy a new shirt to commemorate the occasion.  It was 25% off for fathers day so happy fathers day to me.<br /><br />Jane and Kaia both had facials and hot stone massages.  I can&#8217;t go into any more detail about that. :-)  But they were both glowing and relaxed when they got back.<br /><br />Tonight we are going to go out for some barbeque and then come back to the room and get packed for the final leg of our journey.  Its been a great trip!<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7644008187979668747?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">The call for &#8220;Hooaaahhht Coffeeeeee&#8221; went out at 4:30AM.  It was already twilight in the East and it was time to pack up camp and get on the rafts for the final 3/4 mile of our journey.  We had all come a long way on this trip.  From the first night where everyone managed to find a place to sleep in private, this last night looked like a refugee camp.  We didn&#8217;t have much room and everyone slept right next to everyone else.  Here you can see everyone&#8217;s gear and a corner of what we at first called the &#8220;Miller plot&#8221; and then renamed to Miller Estate.<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigTrq6d5DI/AAAAAAAAAEw/TOHf4QJo2aw/IMG_8125.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8125.JPG" border="0" width="400"  /></div><br /><br />Here you can see the bridge that connects the Kaibab trail from the North to the South wall.  We went a little further downstream to Phantom Ranch and crossed our own bridge.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigU1iMArfI/AAAAAAAAAE0/uWG6QyTQ1fw/P5310154.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5310154.JPG" border="0" width="400"  /></div><br /><br />The facts of the Phantom Ranch trail are as follows:  Its a 10 mile hike from the river to the rim.  It is a 1 mile vertical difference from the river to the rim.  Now the mathematically inclined will say that is only a 10% grade.  Not a problem&#8230;  It was a challenge.  They tell you to have two one liter water bottles and to fill them full at the bottom.  there is a halfway stop called Indian Gardens with a water station and a 3 mile (from the top) stop with a water station and a 1.5 mile stop with a water station.  We filled our water at every stop.  You do drink a LOT of water on this hike.  You are also advised to rest for 30 minutes at each stop if you are having difficulty.<br /><br />We left the river at 7AM and were to Indian Gardens by 10:30.  This is going well we thought.  Unfortunately when you get to Indian Gardens you have only gone 1/4 of the vertical distance.  We finally arrived at the rim at 3:30.  We made a lot of extra stops on the last half of the hike.  Jane did not drink enough water during the first half and was struggling a bit during the second part of the hike.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigW1AjmoOI/AAAAAAAAAE8/mM2EkeXu1AE/P6010159.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P6010159.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />In fact with half a mile remaining she was completely pooped.  We asked one of our fellow hikers to send Josh back to carry Jane&#8217;s pack the last half mile.  Josh wins the good sport award for the day.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigXXjlwX7I/AAAAAAAAAFA/32-a0vXTKC4/P6010162.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P6010162.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />Now you might wonder is the hike worth it for all that work?  Yes, absolutely you get to see the Canyon in a way that you just can&#8217;t imagine by looking down from the rim.  Here you can see some of the trail we came up.  But not all the way to the river that is hidden in the distance.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SigYdfxl7rI/AAAAAAAAAFI/San87ACclXw/P6010161.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P6010161.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br /><br />Pictures don&#8217;t do justice to the amazing beauty of this corner of the world.  We are all really glad we did this trip.  As I&#8217;m writing this from the comfort of the Sedona Hilton, I&#8217;m inspired by the message on my plastic Gin and Tonic glass which says that &#8220;Travel is not about getting from point A to B, Travel should renew your zest for life.&#8221;  This trip has certainly done that.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4275575022097608940?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">For three days we had a great raft trip with Wilderness River Adventures.  The trip was amazing!  For three days we saw the Grand Canyon in a way that few are lucky enough to see, from the bottom up.  As we rafted along we literally saw the history of the world from today to 2 billion years ago.  The beauty of this place is just awe inspiring.<br /><br />We began our trip at Lee&#8217;s Ferry, just south of Page Arizona and ended up at Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  We shared the trip with another small group (Rocky, Joe, and Denise) and one large group from Lafayette College.  <br /><br />The Lafeyette group really made the trip for us.  The group of Geology students was led by Dr. Larry Malinconico (Dr. M) and Dr. Dave Sunderlin.  In my slightly biased opinion I thought that Luther students were the friendliest students anywhere.  The group from Lafeyette taught me that there are other colleges with really great students.  Not only did we learn a lot from lurking in the back of the impromptu lectures but we had a great time getting to know them all.<br /><br />Here are a couple of examples of how beautiful the canyon is.  Here we are in calm water:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUx345cH9I/AAAAAAAAAEQ/YZlnVnlMQ5U/P5300099.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5300099.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />Here was one of our short day hikes.  You can see our rafts to the right.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUyPaMcXYI/AAAAAAAAAEY/F1mBn4QX7Gc/P5290087.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5290087.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />Of course no rafting trip would be complete without the opportunity to get wet, which we are about to do here:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUy6OwIiKI/AAAAAAAAAEc/XfXxVO3Vf-A/P5310138.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="P5310138.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br /><br />And no trip report from me would be complete without a review of the food.  In a word, awesome.  Here are the two swampers (Kari and Everett) preparing our last dinner.  Spaghetti and meatballs, or Alfredo Sauce.  We had Salmon and rice one night, grilled New York Strips and Baby Red Potatoes another night.  It was all &#8220;good eats&#8221;.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiUzrmaaTLI/AAAAAAAAAEk/2sppXUAn_08/IMG_8120.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8120.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />The leaders of the trip were Richard and Matt. Two excellent raft drivers.  Not sure what the proper term is for the captain of a giant rubber raft.  But they got us safely through some really &#8220;fun&#8221; rapids.  At one point the Miller family did experience a collective flashback to being stranded in the Everglades when our raft got hung up on Whale Rock.  This was right in the middle of the biggest rapids of the trip and we were just starting to wonder how we were going to get rescued when the raft freed itself and we were on our way.<br /><br />The sleeping accomodations were better than expected by my standards.  For three nights we just slept on our mats under the stars.  No tents, just sleeping bags, tarps and mats.  It was great.  Since Arizona does not observe daylight savings time, it was dark by 8:30PM and light by 5:00 AM.  So it was an early to bed early to rise kind of trip.  One night I woke up at midnight and got out the camera.  This picture doesn&#8217;t really do justice to the beauty of the night sky in Arizona but it gives you some idea of what we saw from our sleeping bags:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/SiU1KuxAHCI/AAAAAAAAAEo/z07SysNr32o/IMG_8061.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_8061.JPG" border="0" width="400"  /></div><br /><br />The last day of our trip we got up at 4:30AM and went about half a mile downstream to Phantom Ranch.  From there we hiked 10 miles linearly and 1 mile vertically to get out of the Grand Canyon.  I&#8217;ll cover that experience in another post.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4386983974210771226?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">It was an early morning today.  The alarm went off at 5:30 and we were out of the hotel by 5:43.  We made a short drive up to Bryce Point in twilight.  The temperature was only 37 degrees but it did not seem too cold.  We waited a few minutes for the sun to come up over the distant horizon.  When it did we were rewarded with some amazing colors in the canyon:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh9jBITqVyI/AAAAAAAAAEE/J6SXXOYQ4aY/IMG_7744.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7744.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />After sunrise we had breakfast at the hotel and then headed south toward Page.  We had a slot canyon tour booked for 10:30 Arizona time so we thought we had plenty of time.  Unfortunately we ran into an accident that closed highway 89.  We had a nice chat with an over-the-road truck driver as we waited for the ambulance and fire crew to clear the road.<br /><br />We still made it in time for our Antelope Canyon tour.  This was an amazing photographic experience.  I took way to many pictures but I&#8217;m going to have a hard time picking out 10 favorites from the 200 I took.  Here&#8217;s one as a sample.<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh9kduy0QNI/AAAAAAAAAEM/oaSkp66UXFg/IMG_7879.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7879.jpg" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />After checking out the view of the Colorado River we relaxed at the hotel around the pool.  We just got back from our orientation meeting tonight.  We got our waterproof bags to pack all our luggage in.  We are all looking forward to the raft trip starting at 8:15 tomorrow morning.  This will be my last entry until we hike out of the Grand Canyon four days from now.<br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1216461808635227983?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">According to National Park Service literature, the combination of the Navajo loop and the Queens Garden loop is called the best 3 mile hike in the world.  I&#8217;d say they must be right.  The first thing that is just totally amazing is when you first peer over the rim of Bryce Canyon and see the vast expanse of hoodoos and the brilliant red colors.<br /><br />After eating a lunch on the rim of the canyon at Inspiration Point we headed down the rim trail to Sunset Point where the Navajo loop begins.  It seems like every step you take gives you a new perspective and another amazing view.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh30OthFjGI/AAAAAAAAADs/CNdnri06Ej4/IMG_7597.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7597.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />In the middle top of this photo you can see Inspiration Point, our starting location for the day:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh31Zv2TcsI/AAAAAAAAAD0/vSAUGwuXq8k/IMG_7616.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7616.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />Here is another view of Inspiration point from the bottom of the canyon.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh32B5HSnEI/AAAAAAAAAD4/1at9K4i_pJM/IMG_7668.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7668.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br />And here are Kaia and Josh:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh32xLtf2EI/AAAAAAAAAEA/oHbBniuzuX0/IMG_7657.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7657.JPG" border="0" width="400" /></div><br /><br /><br />Dinner tonight was at the Bryce Canyon Pines Restaurant and Diner.  A great family restaurant a few miles from our motel.<br />Incidentally our hotel is the Bryce Canyon Grand Hotel.  Its part of the Ruby&#8217;s General Store empire here at the north entrance to Bryce Canyon national park.  The hotel just opened last week and is very nice.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7389100232081200456?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Our first day of hiking in Zion National Park was great!  Here is our goal for the day:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh0_SUYqOWI/AAAAAAAAADY/xZAwhhwEFYw/IMG_7451.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7451.JPG" border="0" width="640" /></div><br /><br />From the bus stop known as &#8220;The Grotto&#8221; we hiked 2 miles and 1,800 feet up to the top of Angel&#8217;s Landing.  The hike to the saddle point in the middle of the picture was a fairly easy hike on nice wide switchbacks.  The rest of the hike was more exciting.  The park service has helpfully installed chain handrails to help you climb over any rough spots or to help pull yourself up the steep bits.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s a picture of the Miller&#8217;s at the saddle point:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh1JNmyyiJI/AAAAAAAAADk/tsnLyJuUZy4/IMG_3676.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_3676.JPG" border="0"   /></div><br /><br />Here you can see an example of what the last part of Angel&#8217;s landing hike looks like:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh3yGzDxq1I/AAAAAAAAADo/rcCRU6aeYEU/IMG_3659.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_3659.JPG" border="0" width="640" /></div><br /><br /><br />Here&#8217;s a picture of Kaia and I at the top<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sh1BnPIE8jI/AAAAAAAAADc/Q8-fhlfPDYs/IMG_7524.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7524.JPG" border="0" width="640"  /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5888776664201501109?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Long day of traveling today.  Left Minneapolis at 9:05 this morning and just got into our room in Springdale UT at 11:00 Mountain time, or midnight back home.  Actually we checked in a while ago but went straight to the Bit and Spur to have some dinner since our last meal was at Schlotzky&#8217;s in Phoenix.<br /><br />The GPS said it would be a 7 hour drive.  it turned out to be longer than that because we took a side trip to the Desert View overlook in the Grand Canyon.  Here is a view from the Desert View of the Colorado River.  We&#8217;ll be rafting down that river and into the canyon in just a few days.  We will be able to see the watchtower from the river on our way into the canyon!<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sht35AvBjnI/AAAAAAAAADM/5LwsSq8GlS0/IMG_7394.JPG?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7394.JPG" border="0" width="800"  /></div><br /><br />It was still quite a drive from the Grand Canyon to Springdale UT.  Along the way we crossed the colorado river just south of where we will get on the raft.<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/Sht5eQVTyRI/AAAAAAAAADQ/ltwH_N4xuKc/IMG_7426.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="IMG_7426.jpg" border="0" height="600" /></div><br /><br />We drove through Zion National Park in the dark.  We are all looking forward to a great day of hiking in Zion tomorrow.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2640837464153234085?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve seen several interesting blog posts related to MIT switching from Scheme to Python for their intro course.  This is really interesting to me since SICP is one of my favorite CS books of all time.
