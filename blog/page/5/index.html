<p>Our second stop of the day yesterday was at the Rev. P. Hanock Kindergarden.</p>
<p>This &#8216;school&#8217; was a metal building that was a maximum of 12 feet by 12 feet and barely tall enough for Josh Martin to stand in.  This school housed 24 students, about half of which had chairs to sit in.  The students were prepared for us to come, and gave us a concert and a number of demonstrations of their ability to count, and name the colors and the shapes.  It was really impressive and they were all so eager to show off their knowledge.  From the very beginning they instill in these learners the importance of knowledge and going to school. &#8220;Knowledge is our future&#8221; they sing.</p>
<p>In addition to this small classroom there are outhouse facilities donated by Luther alums Orv and Cathy Johnson. The Luther connections here in Namibia are many and strong.  It is almost heartbreaking to see what a relatively small amount of money by American standards can accomplish over here.  We left the kindergarden some blocks and a soccer ball.  The look on the children&#8217;s faces when they emerged from the building to kick the ball around was another of those moments that make you realize what this trip is all about.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of my new friends in the computer science class at Oshigambo High School.  Their teacher, Alice, is an amazing person.  As you can see they are not working with the most modern of computers, but they are doing some really good projects.  The students are learning both Visual Basic, and Turbo Pascal.  They were all eager to show me their projects, which are year long projects.  I saw everything from payroll systems to equipment ordering systems.  These students must first design the entire user interface, and then develop a system flowchart along with a set of written requirements.  Once all of that is done they start building their system using visual basic and access.  I wish more American schools would get this far in their computer science curriculum.</p>
<p>We were getting a short tour of the high school when we walked into the computer lab.  Their teacher said that I was a computer science teacher from the USA.  They immediately pulled me in and I was surrounded by the students.  When I told them I was from Luther College it was as if I were some kind of rock star.  Thanks to Tim Peter and Greg Peterson for brining groups of students to this high school before.  They all well remembered the singing group that was here from Luther 2 years ago.  I signed up a dozen students to get additional admissions information.  I&#8217;m going to ask Scot for a bonus for my recruiting efforts today.  I wish that I would have had more time, to spend with the class.  Many of them had questions and were testing the limits of my pathetic Visual Basic skills. </p>
<p>I was able to give them a demonstration of the Python eBook I&#8217;ve been working on, so maybe that will become a resource that they can use in the future.  I know that after seeing their computer lab everyone was  pleased that we were able to bring them 24 laptops and 50 graphing calculators.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are back on the bus after a stop at the woodcarvers market all of us laughing our heads off.  About 70km North of Windhoek we stopped at the woodcarvers market.  In my mind I had a vision of a sedate little market where Namibian men were sitting and carving interesting wooden masks and bowls.  What ensued was the first &#8220;holy shit&#8221; comment of the day from one of our co-travellers.  While Jane went across the road to the market, I went to the coffee shop to get some coffee.  As Josh and I crossed the road I was approached my a young man who said &#8220;I have your wife&#8221;  A swarm of young men descended on us, come to my shop, come to my shop, the next 20 minutes were pure chaos of bargaining in both US$ and Namibian $.</p>
<p>Now that the dust has settled a bit it appears that the best strategy is to offer somewhere less than half of what they first tell you is the price and work your way up as slowly as you can.  However, we all learned that the hard way.  Our first purchase of this manic shopping spree was a marble bowl.  The asking price was N$650, we countered with N$400 and settled at N$500.  Way to high.  As Jane was literally pulled out of that shop and on to another shop I saw an elephant hair bracelet.  I didn&#8217;t have any Namibian dollars left so I told him I would buy it with US$.  He said $70 US for the bracelet.  I told him no way; but by then the bracelet was already on my arm.  So I told him the leather bracelet I had cost less than $20 he said make me an offer, so I told him $10.  But its made from Elephant hair!!  With that he wrote $50 on his arm.  No way, I said so I came up to $15.  Eventually we settled at $20.  I really do this is one of the best deals I&#8217;ve ever made.</p>
<p>As all of this was taking place young men were trying to lure Mary (Ethan&#8217;s mom) to the outskirts of their little woodcarving village.  Mary resisted with the help of her sister Carol who exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;m not letting you get sold into white slavery&#8221;  Mary was the smartest among us as all she purchased was a single woven basket.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jane was embroiled in making a bargain for a couple of giraffes.  We were rapidly running out of cash, and she was desperately trying to get back to the first stall where she had found a bowl she really liked.  We ended up with the giraffes and two bowls.  Now this young man grabbed the bowls and told us he&#8217;d wrap them for us.  As he was wrapping them he insisted that Jane look at the Salad tongs in his stall.  He proceeded to hold our bowls hostage until Jane finally bought two sets for US$10.  Meanwhile Josh was standing outside the stall saying Mom, we have to go, the bus is going to leave.  Apparently this is a common ploy as one young man was stuffing marble candle holders into Jerry&#8217;s backpack.  Ann had to pull them out and pull Jerry out of the stall in order to escape.</p>
<p>Jane is now trying to sell two of the salad tongs she bought to Josh Martin.  She told him she&#8217;d sell him the one pair for $20 US.  Just think of your mother she said!  If you brought these home to her she&#8217;d know you were thinking about her.  So, Karen, if you want some Namibian salad tongs just let us know, we&#8217;ll make you a really good deal!</p>
<p>I think at the end of the session we had spent about $100 US, or 800 Namibian dollars.  Even if we overpaid for every item it was well worth the price just for the experience.  Plus we figure we are helping these guys make their living and propping up the economy of Okahandja.  Josh Miller and Josh Martin were the only two people who didn&#8217;t spend any money.  Josh had 20 people approach him, and he just kept telling them, I don&#8217;t have any money. I don&#8217;t have any money. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first stop on our free day in Windhoek was at the school for the blind.  We had brought two suitcases of brail books (many Goosebumps stories) with us to take to this school.  We drove up to the school on a short dirt road, and waited a few minutes while Ann and Ethan went to check in with the principal.  It was a a really nice school.  Its interesting to see the design because the hallways between the classroom are all outside.</p>
<p>As I was walking in this young man introduced himself to me, his name was Simon.  I shook his hand and introduced myself as Brad, and before I knew it I was mobbed with students shaking hands and introducing themselves.  They were great and so polite and happy to meet us that it really made me feel happy that we were here.</p>
<p>We got a tour of many of the classrooms.  We saw some very young students learning how to read braille by using a system of blocks.  Put the round blocks in the right holes for a particular letter.  The number of the hole corresponded to a key on the keyboard.  So if you put a block in hole 1 and 5 then you press keys 1 and 5 on your keyboard at the same time.</p>
<p>We met many of the teachers.  None of whom had any particular training in teaching blind or deaf children.  They were all teachers who were just looking for an extra challenge and ended up here.  What the students lack in sight or hearing they make up for in their eagerness to learn.  Many of them, sadly, come from homes where their parents don&#8217;t know how to cope with a disability and so they are suffering from very low self esteem or depression.</p>
<p>I met Anne, who is the computer teacher at the school.  She showed us their computers, which were extremely old.  However she couldn&#8217;t turn any of them on because the school had been without power for several days.  They were promised that it would be back on by last night, but nobody really knows if that will be the case or not.  She said she mainly teaches them word and excel, but also tries to teach them a little bit of programming, &#8220;so that they know about algorithms.&#8221;  When I asked her what language they program in, she said Turbo Pascal!  Jane and I both had the same reaction, I don&#8217;t think people have been teaching pascal for years.  I told her a little about  my textbook project, and at the end of the day we left four laptops for the school, so hopefully the students can maybe start to learn a little Python.</p>
<p>Mr. Engelbrecht, was a young male teacher with a big smile who was just so happy to see us and walk around and talk with us and tell us about the school.  The Principal is a force of nature and at one point provided the quote of the day.  Right after we had finished singing to a group of second graders she remarked in a very pointed tone:  &#8221;Mr.Englebrecht, don&#8217;t you have somewhere else you should be&#8221;  Apparently Mr. E was letting his own students run amok while talking to us.</p>
<p>The highlight of the tour was when we sang to this second grade class.  They started clapping for us after the first time through and as I looked around our group I realized that I wasn&#8217;t the only one singing with a lump in their throat.  The kids were just beaming with joy!  Apparently when they have visitors they usually do a little program, so for us to sing to them was something really special.  It was one of those moments that confirmed that this trip is all worthwhile.</p>
<p>The rest of the group stayed on at the school for the blind, but Gregory and I were off with Mr. Usko Shivute to visit the International University of Management.  We had a very nice meeting the leadership of the school, to see if there are any ways that we can collaborate.  ONe interesting fact we learned was that out of 180 some faculty only 7 have their PhD.  So they are very interested in Faculty development.</p>
<p>After our meeting we had a tour of the facilities, and we met the chief examination officer.  I was very interested to learn that all exams for all classes must be reviewed and approved by the examination officer&#8217;s group.  Of course this means that you have to have all your exams made before the semester even starts.  I can&#8217;t imagine teaching that way!</p>
<p>From there we went to UNAM &#8211; the University of Namibia.  I had a meeting scheduled with the HOD of computer science.  Ms. Kauna Mufeti. The plan was for me to give a talk (A practice talk for me)  about the eBook project.  Sadly, the Dean had rescheduled the faculty meeting from morning to afternoon, so many of the people that would have been at the talk were now required to be at the faculty meeting &#8211; which is compulsory.  Sadly for my Namibian counterparts they do not have a tenure system, so when the dean makes a faculty meeting compulsory, you really do have to go.  Nevertheless we had a great meeting together with a few people in the department and made some great connections.  I hope that we are able to arrange some kind of collaboration to work together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gregory was supposed to meet with the HOD of music, but tracking down his counterpart was a bit more difficult.  In what Greg described as a typical Namibian sequence Kauna called person after person, office after office before we finally located someone for him to meet with.  It turned out to be just the right person, and so when he comes back in 2014 they will meet with some faculty at UNAM.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t get back to the Hotel Safari until almost 5:00.  So we had a few minutes to rest before enjoying a happy hour get together in the Peterson room.  We exchanged stories of the day and laughed together about our experiences with &#8216;African Time&#8217; and then at 7:00 we headed out the door to Joe&#8217;s beer shack.  This is a great restaurant, and quite famous in Windhoek.  Parts of the restaurant are open to the sky and have roaring campfires going to keep everyone warm in the cool Namibian night.  Other parts are covered, but all of it is great.  The menu is full of opportunities to try various kinds of African game.  I ended up with a dish that had Ostrich, Springbok, and Oryx.  Served in a white wine sauce with &#8220;A tot of Whitblit&#8221;  What is a tot of Whitblit you may ask   It turns out that the correct question to ask is how much is a tot?  A tot is roughly the same as a shot, so in the middle of all of this game you get a shot of some liquor called Whitblit, which my spell check keeps wanting to correct to whitebait &#8211; somehow seems appropriate.  We had lots of fun with Ethan trying to surreptitiously take a picture of Ann sipping her Whitblit. Although she&#8217;s officially retired, she seems to think she can keep Ethan from graduating if any pictures of the former Dean of Students are posted on Facebook.  I think Ethan may take that as a challenge.</p>
<p>Others in the party had Zebra, Crocodile (a bit fishy) and other African game animals.  Maybe even a regular old beef stake.  We ate and laughed and had a great time.  When desert time finally came around there were many orders of Don Pedro &#8211; which is a milkshake with some liquor added.  In our case we went with the Amarulo which is the African equivalent of Bailey&#8217;s Irish Cream.  Delicious!!</p>

<p>Our first full day in country and our first day of touring the Windhoek area.</p>
<p>We started this morning at 9:00 with most of us sleeping in until 7:30 or 8:00.  You know we needed the sleep when we were able to overcome the jet lag that quickly.  We drove through the city and into the Katatura township, We are told that this township will be positively luxurious compared to some of the others we will see.  One thing we noticed was even though the poverty was obvious, there was very little litter and trash on the ground.  Everywhere you look you see tiny little shops, barber shops, hair salons, cell phone shops, Bars that are just big enough for a few people to squeeze in.</p>
<p>From Katatura we continued on the Penduka.  This is a sort of Women&#8217;s collective where they make and sell all kinds of hand crafts.  Of particular interest was how they refashion old glass bottles into jewelry, particularly beaded jewelry.  The picture shows the kiln used to melt the glass and to fire the pottery.  We got a full tour of the place, and met a few of the women working on different projects.</p>

<p>After a quick stop at the Parliament, and an unsuccessful attempt to visit the Christkirche we visited the meteorite monument in downtown Windhoek.  Evidently Ethan was getting a little tired of site seeing by this time and needed a break for lunch.  Which we took at Schneider.  Jane had some delicious Curry Wurst, and Josh, Josh, and I all went for the Stroghanoff with Spaetzel.  Schneider had some nice outdoor seating, and was surprisingly fast and cheap for a center city lunch stop.</p>
<p>After lunch was the well timed trip to the &#8216;Diamond Factory&#8217;  We learned a little about diamonds, and then had a tour of the showroom.  The tour began with some free glasses of Champagne and ended at the Tanzanite stand.  Long time readers of this blog may remember the Tanzanite story from Mexico and how that ended.  This was had a somewhat similar, though less expensive, ending to the story.  It seems fitting to get some Tanzanite while we&#8217;re in Africa,especially since our 26th anniversary is only 2 days away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;You must really like to fly&#8221;  was the comment of the  flight attendant from Scotland on our British Air flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg.  What prompted the statement was my comment that I would have the curried chicken because &#8220;that was good last night.&#8221; &#8211; We&#8217;ll return to the concept of good airplane food later.   Its Monday.  We left Chicago on Saturday. Two overnight flights in a row with a nine hour layover in London.  I feel like I&#8217;ve been in the airport forever.  Now we are waiting out our final layover in Johannesburg for the final leg of our flight to Windhoek.  We are in Africa, but it doesn&#8217;t really seem like it yet.  We&#8217;ve got to get out of the airport and into the real world.  The Empowering Learners trip is well underway.</p>
<p>Because we had such a long london layover we did leave the airport and take the tube into London.  We walked around the London School of Economics with Josh Martin, and then meandered through the South Bank area having lunch at Giraffe.  Yesterday was a hard day, the overnight flight with the 6 timezone change really messes you up.  This morning was easier as we flew mostly north to south, crossing only one time zone.  We are really thankful to the gate agent in Chicago who rearranged our seats on this flight so that we had the aisle seats in the middle section with nobody in between us.  We were able to stretch out and get some decent rest last night.</p>
<p>About this trip.  This is not just a trip for fun, this is partly a mission trip and partly a cultural experience.  The trip is organized by Empowering Learners, a non profit organized by Ethan Schultz, and Ann Sponberg-Peterson.  The goal is to bring 24 laptop computers and 50 calculators to the Oshigambo high school in Northern Namibia.  We also carried along an assortment of Braille books, and Soccer balls to distribute along the way.  There are a total of 12 of us on the trip and we got all of this stuff along with us in carry on and checked baggage, we are definitely going to be a lot lighter on the drive home than we on the trip here.  Once we complete our business working with the high school we&#8217;ll be visiting the Etosha Game Park and the Atlantic Coast in Swakopmund.  More detail to follow.</p>
<p>For now we are safely checked in at the Safari Court Hotel.  After two nights sleeping on airplanes and having our morning coffee in airports, we are all ready for a shower!   As a group we will have a little break before meeting with our tour guide for the trip and then heading to downtown Windhoek for a meal at a nice German restaurant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a week its been!   So much has happened in the last week that I just have to take some time out to organize my thoughts and get some of this information out there where others can read it.</p>&#13;
<h3>What is Runestone Interactive?</h3>&#13;
<p>Runestone Interactive is primarily a home for both the content and the technologies that go into publishing interactive textbooks.  At the moment interactive textbooks for Computer Science, but who knows how far this could go.  Probably the best way to see this is to actually visit our site and play around.  But in the meantime here is a short video to give you an introduction.</p>&#13;
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Us4fpoNht68" width="560"></iframe> </p>&#13;
<ol><li>Home to our open source publishing tools.  My goal as that these tools become the LaTeX of interactive publishing. There is lots of work to do before we can claim success here, but I think we have a good vision and a decent start.</li>&#13;
<li>A model for a new online only publishing house. At some point, I think it is important for content to go through an editorial process, not just for copy editing quality, but for coherence, and quality of approach. Right now the number of content creators using our system is pretty small, but I can already see that starting to grow. We have lots of thinking to do about this.</li>&#13;
<li>A home for hosting online courses or textbooks.</li>&#13;
</ol><h3>Who is your audience?</h3>&#13;
<p>At the moment, I think we serve three distinct groups of people.</p>&#13;
<ol><li>The  teacher out there who wants a good quality textbook, but is not interested in forcing their students to pay $100+ and is interesting in trying an interactive book, all for free.   So to serve this audience we have <a href="http://interactivepython.org">interactvepython.org</a>. You can select one of our pre-defined books and set up a course where you are the instructor and have access to grading etc. Or you can use the drag-and-drop interface to put together a book by selecting from the library of modules. Maybe some of these teachers have an exercise or two they would like to contribute, but mostly they are just looking for good materials to help them with their course.</li>&#13;
<li>Authors who would like to contribute significant chunks of content &#8211; chapters or section sized &#8211; or videos. For example I&#8217;m working with an entrepreneur who wants to add content and a graphics package that looks more like Nodebox. He&#8217;s very interested in putting together materials for middle school kids.  Others, including other Computer Science researchers, are more interested in algorithm visualization and working together on building in more visualization tools to the tool box.  Others have their own CS course materials that they would like to get into an interactive form and make available to the world.</li>&#13;
<li>People who are interested in learning CS on their own.  We get a ton of people coming to the site just to learn on their own. I had the most heartfelt letter from a guy the other day who found our site as he is trying to retool after being laid off for a couple of years. He said this is the first thing he&#8217;s come across that really worked for him and helped him learn a bit of CS.  How does this compare with Udacity and Coursera?  Both of those companies are primarily video oriented, and both of those companies are running courses that are in some sense synchronous.  You have to move through the course on their schedule to get the full benefit.  Our books/courses can be done at your own pace, on your own time.</li>&#13;
</ol><div> </div>&#13;
<h3>I would like to use this for my own class how do I get started?</h3>&#13;
<p>Its easy, just follow these steps:</p>&#13;
<ol><li>Go to<a href="http://interactivepython.org"> interactivepython.org</a> and register yourself as a user.</li>&#13;
<li>Click on Create a Custom Course link in the right sidebar.</li>&#13;
<li>Select a short name for your course that uniquely identifies it among all the other courses.</li>&#13;
<li>Type in a short description for your course</li>&#13;
<li>Now you get to choose.  Do you want to use one of our standard configurations, either How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition, or Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python  or do you want to build a custom book by choosing modules from both of the above?</li>&#13;
<li>Click on the build button.  Wait a few minutes and you will have a page with a link to your new course.</li>&#13;
</ol><div>Now you can send your students to interactivepython.org and simply tell them to register for your course.  </div>&#13;
<div> </div>&#13;
<div>Why would you choose to build your own course when you could just use one of the open books?  When you create your own course you become the instructor and admin for that course.  You can grade your students assignments right online, and even access their homework in progress if they have questions.  You can also get a sense for the different activities they are choosing to use in the textbook.</div>&#13;
<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>&#13;
<p>There are lots of ways you can get involved:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>We need readers who are willing to be critical and report bugs on everything from typos to activecode blocks that don&#8217;t work exactly right.</li>&#13;
<li>We need web developers who are willing to work on the back end, developing reports for instructors and making sure our infrastructure is sound.</li>&#13;
<li>We need web developers who are interested in developing user facing features, everything from algorithm visualizations to interactive assessment tools like the multiple choice and fill in the blank questions you see already.</li>&#13;
<li>We need compiler geeks who can help fix bugs in our Javascript implementation of Python.</li>&#13;
<li>We need authors who want to add new and interesting content, either entire courses, or new modules that could be combined with the modules already there.</li>&#13;
</ul>
