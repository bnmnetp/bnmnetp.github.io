  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I&#8217;m through security.  Sitting in  Segafredo Zanetti, enjoying a very nice Israeli Chardonnay.  Everyone told me to get to Ben Gurion at least 3 hours before my flight so that I could get through the security process.  Now I understand why.  These people are serious about their security.</p>
<p>When you first get to the airport you have to get in a line to get your luggage X-rayed before you even get to check in for your flight and get your boarding pass.  This is the initial grilling.  Passport please? Long study of the passport followed by a long study of my face.   Why were you in israel, where did you stay, do you have a receipt?  Did anyone give you a present?   Where has your luggage been?  Is it remotely possible that someone could have gotten access to your luggage? You were at a conference?  Can you prove it? and on and on…  Finally when he seemed satisfied, there was much flipping through my passport and studying of dates and places.  Are these guys working for Mosad or are they low level airport security employees??  My bet is on the former.  Dude, I&#8217;m trying to leave your country not smuggle something in.  Once you get past this initial questioning, your luggage is put through some kind of industrial strength X-ray machine.  When the X-ray is done your bag is pretty much ejected as if being shot out of a cannon.</p>
<p>The British airways desk is pretty easy compared to the initial grilling.  And because it takes so long to answer all of the questions and get your bags X-rayed, the lines at the checkin counter are pretty short.  Sadly I did not get a free upgrade from Israel to London.  But, I did get an aisle seat.</p>
<p>Now you have to go through security.  Passport and boarding pass.  Everything out.  OK, my Namibian Rock sculpture seems to be a real curiosity.  Thank God I didn&#8217;t bring the Magnetite!  I think the rock sculpture went back and forth through the X-ray machine 3 times in three different orientations.  Finally, all was well and I was able to proceed.</p>
<p>Just when you thought you were done… passport control.  Again with the questions, and studying of the passport.</p>
<p>Finally you are through.  Now, here&#8217;s the final indignity.  My guide for the morning had told me that the Golan Heights Chardonnay was well worth getting in the duty free shop.  Sounds great.  So, I head to the &#8220;worlds largest duty free&#8221; and ask the guy where the Golan Heights Chardonnay is.  Right here sir.  But…. &#8220;Are you flying to the US?&#8221;   Yes I am.  Well, sir, you are not allowed to take any liquids into the USA if you are coming from Israel.  Really??  But, its duty free, I thought that was allowed.  &#8221;I&#8217;m sorry sir, they do not trust our security&#8221;</p>
<p>Good Grief.</p>
<p>P.S.  Yes, there was one more passport check as I passed out of the common area and onto my concourse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its official folks, I&#8217;m ready to head home.  The ITiCSE conference is over.  The paper has been presented, I&#8217;ve been to a dozen or more sessions.  I&#8217;m tired.  I&#8217;d like to get something to eat, but all the restaurants in the area are not even open for dinner yet, and its 7pm!  This is a good conference.  I appreciate that many of the sessions seem a bit more technical than would be typical at SIGCSE and I like that.</p>
<p>Although I was here alone at the conference I&#8217;ve met some really nice people, and made some good connections with others doing research in areas that overlap with <a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org">Runestone Interactive</a> in one way or another.  I&#8217;ve got a lot of ideas about what may be good directions to go next with the project, and lots of ideas on some new literature that I should be studying.</p>
<p>So, whats left of this trip?  Tomorrow I&#8217;m taking a tour of Cesarea that will start at 7:30 tomorrow morning and will end with me getting dropped off at the airport at 2pm.  The buzz at the conference this afternoon was about getting out of Isreal.  Apparently, security is much tougher going out of the country than it is going in.  So it is recommended to be at the airport 3 hours ahead of your flight.  I&#8217;ll fly to Heathrow and I&#8217;ve got a room at the Sofitel.  That just seems to make the most sense.  I don&#8217;t have to find and pay for a bus to drop me off at another hotel, as I can just walk.  It has free WiFi, and it will be easy for me to walk back over and go through security in the morning to rejoin the group.  I really miss being with the group.   Saturday we fly from London to Chicago and then we still have five hours of driving to get us home.  Its actually hard to imagine that I will be home in roughly 48 + 8 hours.  The +8 is the hours that are lost to timezone changes.</p>
<p>As I was sitting outside my hotel writing this I had the good fortune to be invited to dinner by one of my new colleagues that I met at ITiCSE.  David was traveling with his family and it was very nice to have a relaxing dinner again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, here we are on the B2 not 55km from Windhoek and the Safari Hotel.  Suddenly our coach makes a very bad noise and we begin to coast down the road.  Joey looks rather concerned.  We coast to a stop and pull over to the side of the road.  One of the few places in all of Namibia where there is almost no shoulder.  The diagnosis is dire, the clutch plate is out.  Luckily its only 1:15 in the afternoon and we are close to our destination.  David is on the phone getting another coach on its way.  This bus that we&#8217;ve spent so many hours with is not taking us any further.</p>
<p>So far we are all in good spirits.  The sun is out, the weather is nice.  We are joking about our plight and assessing our provisions.  In the cooler we have some apples, a half bottle of Riesling and one Windhoek light.  Suddenly Joey says… &#8220;I need a beer!&#8221;  We all crack up, we&#8217;d be happy to give Joey our last beer, he&#8217;s been such a good sport with great humor this entire trip.</p>
<p>We are thankful that this little mishap happened here.  When we think of all the places this could have happened. The middle of Etosha, the middle of the desert, Each of which would be hours and hours from anywhere likely to have the ability to come and get us.  We&#8217;ll be just fine, and this answers the important question of what to write about in today&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  We&#8217;re moving again, in a lovely, highly air conditioned coach.  Its just 2:55 so we were only delayed about 1:45.  When the replacement bus got here we formed a bucket brigade and transferred the luggage from one to the other in no time.  We&#8217;re looking forward to arriving at the Safari and we&#8217;ll still have some time to relax and refresh before we go to our dinner at Nampa and Matty&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>The first adventure of the day was the Living Desert tour with Tommy.  Tommy is a fabulous guide, we laughed our way through the tour as this guy is just one great one-liner after another.   We saw lots of interesting desert wildlife, all of which lives in the sand.  The photo is of Ann with a desert lizard clipped to her ear.  </p>
<p>Along the way we also found an Chameleon, a sidewinder, a horned adder, and lots of different beetles.  You just can&#8217;t believe the beauty of the sand dunes.  These are the largest in the world with some of them over 1000 feet tall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aaaah relief!   After 3 days with absolutely no internet access we made a stop at an internet cafe this morning, where we all took to the internet like people who&#8217;d been deprived of water for three days.  Amazingly there was very little of importance in my inbox, so I guess all is well with the world.  I&#8217;m writing this on the bus as we make our six hour drive from the Etosha Safari Lodge down to Swakopmund.  Today we&#8217;ll travel through both hill country and then through the Namib desert down to the coastal town of Swakopmud where we&#8217;ll stay at the ELCRN guest house.  Swakopmund has been described as a slightly larger version of New Ulm Minnesota for those of you from Minnesota.</p>
<p>Yesterday was another amazing day.  We got up fairly early to observe a few animals at the Moringa water hole at the Halali Rest Camp, but it was a pretty quiet morning.  A few zebras, some Kudu, and a bunch of Guinea Hens.  We had some breakfast, and then set out for the day.  We had to be out of the park by 5:30PM (sundown) and we had a lot of animal viewing in store.</p>
<p>There were two real highlights of the day.  First, we witnessed a herd of 42 yes 42 elephants!  This herd included elephants of all ages, including babies up to the old bull that was clearly in charge of it all.  We saw to older males challenging each other for something, and younger males emulating them.  Its interesting to see them face off, then wrap their trunks together and then go head to head pushing on each other.  Just think of the strength behind all that pushing.  We even heard the old male trumpet to get everyone&#8217;s attention and get the herd moving again.  At one point they must have smelled a lion or a leopard because everyone started running.  This didn&#8217;t last very long and soon they were back to drinking at the water hole.  This must have been a unique gathering because even the Namibian&#8217;s who were working on building a solar water pump were taking a break to watch all of this action.</p>
<p>We saw this same behavior with a  huge herd of Springbok and a dazzle of Zebra earlier in the day.  They were just standing around doing whatever springbok and Zebras do, when all of the sudden they all took off, David said this is because they smell a leopard.  After running a ways they stopped and stood very still, all of them just staring in one direction.  We tried to see what they were looking at but couldn&#8217;t see anything but grass and bushes.</p>
<p>The second highlight of the day came at the end of the day when we saw Lions again.  Its amazing we saw them at all, they blend into the grass so well.  On one side of the road were four mature lions just sunning themselves, literally lying on their backs legs spread apart, soaking up the sun. Finally one of them got up and moved to a new spot so we were able to get a really good look.  On the other side of the road was a Lioness and her cubs, at first all we spotted were the ears sticking up next to one of the bushes, but with patience we were finally rewarded with some nice views of all the cubs and the mother.</p>
<p>A lot of what we saw today was the same animals that we have been seeing since entering the park, and after a while you just get numb to the whole thing until you remind yourself what a rare opportunity it is to see these animals in their natural habitat.  Animal Kingdom this is not.  One of the new animals we did see today was the heartbeats, another antelope that is the second fastest.  It gets its name from its horns which look like a heart when you see them from the front.</p>
<p>Its really crazy that we have just two days in Swakopmund and then on Sunday we head back to Windhoek in preparation for leaving Namibia on Monday. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Pastor Chad,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing today to let you know that I won&#8217;t be in church for a while, probably about a year.  Believe me when I say that it is not your fault or the fault of anyone at First Lutheran.  Its just that I attended an ordination service for the Evangelical Lutheran Church In Namibia (ELCIN) here in Namibia, at the brand new church in the  Onesi parish.  This church just opened in April of this year so it was a great honor for them to host the ordination.  It is a large, but simple church built of bricks with a metal corrugated roof.  Its laid out in a traditional cross shape.    I have a number of points to share with you but I&#8217;ll get right to the main reason for my absence…  The service lasted from 9AM until 4PM, yes SEVEN hours of church without a single break.  In my humble opinion I&#8217;ve now earned more than a few weeks off.</p>
<p>The bulletin we got when we arrived had a schedule on it.  The Ordination service started at 9:00AM right on time, it was to be done by 10:30 when the newly ordained would lead a full worship service.  At 12:00 we were to receive the greetings.  In reality, the worship service started at 12:30 and the greetings section started about 2:30.  Things last as long as they last here in Africa.  As you can guess, nobody would have any problem with the service going a little over an hour.</p>
<p>During the seven hours I was sitting on a plastic chair I had some time to reflect on what we might learn from the Namibians, and I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to share them with you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start with Hospitality.  You need to know that the church was overflowing with people from all over the country, and indeed the world.  The bishop from  neighboring Angola and representatives from the government, local tribal leaders, and the governor of this part of the country.  There appears to be very strong cooperation between the church and state in this country.  There were probably 2,000 people in attendance, and many of them had to be seated outside.  </p>
<p>We arrived on our bus about 10 minutes before the service started, after driving three hours, including the last 28 kilometers on dirt roads.  We  were far from the the last ones there as we passed an amazing number of people walking to the service.  Many of them walked many miles, others were packed into the back of pickup trucks like sardines.  However, when we arrived we were ushered right over to an empty pew, reserved just for our group.  Unfortunately we did not all fit in our allotted pew, so Ethan and I were shown to the back row of the section reserved for pastors.  When the pastors processed in it was very clear that they needed our spots desperately, so we tried to move, but they wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with that!  Eventually plastic chairs were brought in and we were moved so that we could sit closer to our group.  Now here&#8217;s an example of the kind of hospitality we should all aspire to, within a few minutes all of us were shuffled yet again, but this time we had pastors in our midst that served as translators for us for the entire service!  Some had their own personal translator while others were in pairs.  These pastors graciously shared their Oshiovambo hymnals with us, so that we could do our best to sing along on the SEVEN hymns on the hymn board.  And those seven were just a start, there were many many more that were sung as impromptu additions to the service. Amazingly, almost all of the hymn tunes were very familiar, so we could just about sing along in english using the words we remembered.</p>
<p>A note about the ELCIN and their need for pastors.  There is a great need for pastors here in Namibia, we were told that the ELCIN needs 40 pastors, which means that many congregations must make do with lay leadership only.  Today there were 5 candidates for ordination, but lest you think that each year they ordain five new pastors, we learned that they only do an ordination service every four years.  So for the candidates and the parishes this was a huge celebration.</p>
<p>We were treated as honored and distinguished guests the entire day.  During the greetings section of the service (which lasted an hour and a half)  our group was invited to come to the front and share a song.  So, we sang our Yalo song &#8211; in  Oshiovambo &#8211;  and we were rock stars!  Of course we were already something of an oddity since other than three Finnish missionaries, we were the only white people in attendance.  After the service we were invited to dine with the presiding bishop to celebrate the occasion.  We were definitely in Lutheran hands as the dinner accommodations included carrot raisin salad, macaroni, and potato salad.   In a true namibian twist the meat section of the buffet featured grilled intestines along with several other options more appealing to the midwestern pallet.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to the Youth program.  While Adrian does an exceptional job, someone here in Namibia has really got this figured out.  In the crowd of people at this service were kids of all ages, and they stayed the entire time!  Many of the young kids sat on the floor near the front the entire service.  In addition, since the church was overflowing we saw 20-30 teen aged youth who stood outside the church putting their heads in the windows.  Yep, they stood in the windows for the entire service.  What an amazing thing.  Many of the parishes brought their youth choirs who were allowed to sing one and only one song during the collection of the offering.  They were awesome.  After the service there was a sort of impromptu battle of the choirs as they stood outside trying to out-sing each other.</p>
<p>Now here is what we might learn about stewardship from these great people.  Before the offering was taken an announcement was made.  First of all they were a bit short the previous week, so all were admonished to give generously.  She made the point that paper donations were definitely preferred over coins.  When the offering started, the choirs kicked in.  But now everyone was ushered to the front where a large basket was placed on a  chair, people came forward and placed their donations in the basket one by one.  Ethan told us that in other services he&#8217;d attended the offering might be taken up to three times, so you should plan ahead and divide your offering in thirds.</p>
<p>In terms of staffing I might say that having a master of ceremonies is an interesting idea.  A very distinguished older lady, Meme, in the native language, was in charge of first, letting everyone know how the service would unfold, and what to do when.  Again this is a nice way to help visitors feel at home and know whats coming up.  She did tend to ramble on and on a bit, as even our translators rolled their eyes after a while.  But her heart was clearly in the right place.  So the lesson here is that if we go this direction, we should choose this position with care.</p>
<p>Finally, I need to apologize to you.  In the ELCIN pastors are not called, they are sent, and in some cases the pastor is the first the congregation has ever had.  Nevertheless, I don&#8217;t feel that you received  a proper welcome at First Lutheran.  After the pastors were ordained the secretary general formally announced where they were sent.  When the parish name was called the people of the parish stood and cheered, and clapped.   The women Ulilated and waved zebra tails in the air.  If that doesn&#8217;t make a guy feel welcome I don&#8217;t know what would.</p>
<p>Well, its about time to pack up the bus and head into Etosha national park.  You know I was just kidding about skipping for a year right?</p>
<p>Take care, and see you soon.</p>
<p>Brad</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It really does remind you of a scene out of Dune, and at times its like you are on another world.  The sand is so fine, but yet its not dusty, its clean.  This is the Namib Desert, the oldest desert in the world and home to the worlds largest sand dunes.  The tallest of the dunes is over 1000 feet tall, you have to keep reminding yourself that its all sand!  These aren&#8217;t hills with a little sand on the top, this is a moveable work of sand art that is hundreds of feet high and changes all the time.</p>

<p>To start off our day we went on a Living Desert tour with Tommy, the owner of the company.  He had a giant WWII vintage Land Rover (He collects land rovers &#8211; and large belt buckles )  He&#8217;s fifty something always wears shorts, runs like a bow legged cowboy and has more one liners than anyone I have ever met.  He had us all in tears by the end of the tour.  &#8221;All the desert creatures are just like a beautiful woman, you treat them gently and with respect and everything will be fine&#8221; he says with a grin.  &#8221;When I met my wife, I said I am the head of the household, she said fine, I am the neck you will look where I point you.&#8221;   He was also extremely knowledgeable about the whole desert ecosystem.</p>
<p>You think what desert ecosystem?  What lives in a bunch of giant piles of sand where they only get 15millimeters of rain a year?  It turns out quite a lot, but you pretty much have to dig up everything out here that is alive.  For the first 45 minutes of the trip it was pretty quiet because it was overcast and quite cool, Tommy kept jumping out of the land rover muttering, I just have to check on something.  He would trot away up the dune, stop at a seemingly random spot and then scoop his arm down deep in the sand.  Or he would run up to one of the dollar bushes and poke around with his sand wedge for a few minutes only to return to the vehicle saying &#8220;nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, one of these little forays paid off, he put his hand behind his back and with a huge grin on his face beckoned for us to get out and join him.  Our first specimen was a lizard of some sort that he talked about how it survived by burrowing in the sand, water comes from the fog that rolls in off the Atlantic, just a few drops are all that is required, it turns out it also makes its own water by a chemical reaction with the food it eats.  Pretty cool.  Then, the showman asks Mary to kneel before him (&#8220;I like it when women kneel in front of me&#8221; he says) Then he takes the lizard and lets it clamp onto her earlobe with its tiny little jaws.  &#8221;New Earrings!!&#8221;  Oh, my, all the women in the group are subjected to this little bit, and we get some great photos.  </p>
<p>I ask him, how he knows where to dig, he says &#8220;I read the bushman daily newspaper&#8221;  You see the very top layers of the sand are a combination of sand and magnetite which makes very interesting wave like patterns.  Once you learn the signs to look for they are pretty obvious.  He&#8217;s been scanning for sidewinder tracks since the beginning, and although we&#8217;ve seen some tracks, no snakes yet.  So, he stops the rover next to a particularly magnetite rich area, and hops out with his hand and something else inside a plastic grocery bag.  We follow him a little ways up the dune and he drops down to his knees and proclaims, &#8220;now I will show you how we iron the desert.&#8221;  Of course he&#8217;s got a magnet inside the bag and its picking up tons of the tiny magnetite particles.  After showing us some artwork, and dumping a bunch of magnetite on Mary&#8217;s arm to show us how he can make the hair stand up on end, he asks if anyone would like it?  Sure!  I&#8217;m thinking this would make a great plaything for my office.  Now I&#8217;m wondering how in the world I&#8217;m going to get a tennis ball sized blob of magnetite through airport security!!??</p>
<p>Eventually we find our sidewinder, also buried in the sand, along with a horned viper, a gecko, and tow very interesting chameleons.  All in all it was really interesting to see all this life where its pretty easy to assume that none exists.  We continue our journey with Tommy finishing up the full morning with a joy ride through the sand dunes in his giant four by four.  The scenery in the dunes is spectacular.  </p>
<p>The only thing marring this perfect desert landscape is the tents from the Mad Max IV film crew that is running around and apparently doing lots of things they should not be doing in the desert, one of them being messing with Tommy&#8217;s schedule &#8211;  &#8221;The idiot, in a match between a Range Rover and a human, who does he think is going to win?&#8221;</p>
<h2>ATV Ride!</h2>
<p>After leaving the Dunes Tommy dropped us off for the next part of our adventurous day.  A Desert eXplorers ATV and sand boarding trip. After the requisite signing of the legal waivers we are quickly outfitted with hairnets and helmets.  &#8221;Do I really need one?&#8221; I ask rubbing my very short hair.  Josh&#8217;s answer is short and practical, &#8220;Keeps out the lice Dad&#8221;  Hmmm.  Then we are given a choice between the automatic or manual clutch ATVs.  We all wisely choose the automatics.  After a few quick instructions about hand signals we are off!  Driving through the dunes is amazing, the hardest part is that you really do have to pay attention and follow the leader or else there are lots of places where you could get stuck or end up upside down.  As we go along we get more and more adventurous, taking the ATVs way up steep banks and straight down even steeper run outs.  Its exhilarating and tons of fun.</p>
<p>After an hour or so of this we stop at a particularly tall and steep dune.  This is our sand boarding stop.  Sandboarding is done on a piece of particle board that our guide waxes up for us. you lay down on it, pull up the front and away you go, down the dune.  Its a lot like going sledding in the winter only a lot drier.  Also a lot like sledding is that its not really much fun to trudge back up the dune, your shoes filling with sand and sinking up to your ankles in the sand.  Its a lot of work!  But we had a lot of fun, and I got my first chance to use our new head cam, to capture my runs down the dune.  Cool!</p>
<p>Now we have about an hour of ATV riding through the dunes left, but its getting to be 4:30 so the sun is getting a bit low in the sky and there are lots more shadows now, this makes it all a bit more tricky.  We are almost to the very end when our guide suddenly motions us to stop and whips his ATV around and goes racing back.  We all crane our necks to see whats going on.  Its Ann, she&#8217;s tipped her ATV over in that last little bumpy patch.  Not only is our guide racing toward her but three other guides in blaze orange that were leading other groups have seen the accident and rush to her aid.  After a few anxious moments we can see that she&#8217;s up and walking, her trusty hand bag still still at her side.  Jerry says it was a spectacular fall.  Ann says all of her orifices are still full of sand.  We&#8217;re all just thankful that she walked away with nothing more than a twisted knee.  Its a bit swollen and sore but she&#8217;s still getting around.  This is definitely a day we will all remember for a long time!</p>
<p>We finally get back to the guest house at about 5:15 tired, and very hungry, other than a few little candy bars and some trail mix we haven&#8217;t eaten anything during the day.  The rest of the group bought happy hour supplies and made a 7:00 dinner reservation, so we drink some champagne to toast Gregory and Ann&#8217;s anniversary.  We laugh about the fact that we had two anniversaries on this trip, but both occurred during our stays in decidedly unromantic accommodations!  Finally we head out for dinner to the Tug, a seafood restaurant right on the Jetty.  We enjoy some good food in a nice warm dry atmosphere before walking back and going to sleep in our somewhat less warm and less dry rooms at the guest house.  We remark once again that we&#8217;ve said the same thing about so many of our days here in Namibia, &#8220;What a day!  I&#8217;m going to remember this for a long time&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a long day of driving and viewing the animals we pulled into our accommodations at Halial Rest Camp in Etosha National Park.  Although it was a long dusty day of driving we saw many game animals (see my related post) on the drive so it was well worth it.</p>
<p>We had made the decision in the morning to have a Braai for supper tonight, so we bought steaks and pasta and some supplies for making sauce at the Pic-N-Pay in Oshikati.  Based on the descriptions of our Bush Chalets we knew that we had an outdoor grilling area (the Braai) along with cooking supplies and utensils in the room.  The Bush Chalets are just fantastic, ours was two bedroom, with a living area and separate toilet and shower areas.   All of which looked quite new.  The only problem was that the cooking supplies were missing!  We all had some plates and bowls and silverware, but no pots or pans suitable for cooking.</p>
<p>COOL!!  This is like a Quick Fire challenge on Top Chef.  We got some firewood and kindling from the gift shop and talked Joey out of his lighter for five minutes to get the fire going.  We slit open the steaks and added some namibian barbecue dry rub to them along with a little salt and pepper, let them site for a while and the steaks are taken care of.</p>
<p>But how do you cook pasta and pasta sauce with no pots and pans.  Well, we all had hot pots in our room for boiling water to make coffee or tea.  If you can boil water you can cook noodles.  To make the sauce we just opened the cans (thank God for swiss army knives) and set them next to the fire.  Add a helping of noodles to the bowl, spoon out some tomatoes and some pureed tomatoes and a few mushrooms from their respective cans and viola you have a nice sauce for your noodles.</p>
<p>Add in some raw veggies, and some grilled red and yellow peppers and you have a regular feast.  Of course a couple of glasses of wine at happy hour probably helped make it all taste better than it was but it will definitely go down as one of the more memorable meals of the trip.  After supper we continued to sit around the fire and talk and share great memories with each other.  It was a great night, thanks friends.</p>
