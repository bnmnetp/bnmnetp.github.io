  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just boarded the train from Bern to Laussane, we are on the upper floor of our coach, and packed in like sardines.  There is not nearly enough room for luggage storage so our suitcases are on our laps, and in the aisles and generally anywhere we can find room.  Its a bit crazy and all of our traveling companions that were already aboard the train must really wonder about this group of Americans.  Thankfully we only have an hour on this leg of the journey and then we are in Lausanne.</p><p><img title="IMG_2141.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSsHTNjjFAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/Vzrxuo8D30c/IMG_2141.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2141.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>Just before we left the hostel this morning we had another casualty.  Josh was zipping up his suitcase in the lobby and it exploded, just like in the movies.  The zipper is shot.  So, the helpful woman at the front desk provided us with some packing tape!  Jeff and I held the suitcase while josh wrapped it about 8 times around with the packing tape.  This will get him from Interlaken to Lausanne, although I did pick up one sock that fell out along the way.  Luckily I saw Josh washing clothes last night so I was pretty sure it was a clean one.</p><p>Meanwhile, here&#8217;s an update on skiing etc.  I turned in my snowboard for a pair of skis and boots.  As a result, yesterday was extremely enjoyable.  I skied with Craig, Nick, Jessica, and Camille.  Mostly the red runs all day long.  Even though I haven&#8217;t been on skis for a few years it came back right away.  The views were spectacular, although the runs were still pretty icy in many places.  I felt much more confident on the skis than I did on the snowboard and so was able to enjoy the day much more.  We took the train all the way to Kleine Scheidegg which is the highest point the train goes that serves the ski villages and lifts.  We were able to get several runs in on each of the three lifts that start in the Kleine Scheidegg area.  We skiid the Lauberhorn run which goes all the way down to Grindelwald, then took the small trams back to Mannlichen and worked our way over lift by lift to get back to Kleine Scheidegg.  We were very hungry by this time so we had lunch and then skied down to Grindelwald train station and declared victory.  Much fun, and no injuries in the group!</p><p><img title="IMG_2132.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSsHVDMW46I/AAAAAAAAAJc/yEzY0gYHwRo/IMG_2132.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="IMG_2132.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>Later, back at the Hostel, as I was coming up to check my email Matt asked me &#8220;Where is the hospital?&#8221;  Oh good God I thought to myself.  Yes, we have another injury.  It turned out that Nody separated his shoulder.  At least this one is not a going-home kind of injury and won&#8217;t really slow him down.  The only thing will be that someone will have to carry his backpack.</p><p>So, now we need a luggage porter for Aaron, and a backpack carrier for Eric.  We are very thankful that the skiing portion of the trip is over.  Just now one of the students said, hey lets try ski jumping when we&#8217;re in Lausanne!   I think its time to nix that idea before it catches on!</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7252832626500874856?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The morning started out like any other morning, up at 7:00, a light breakfast, then hop on the bus to the ski slopes.  OK, maybe not like every other morning, but a pretty desirable thing to aspire to anyway.</p><p>To get to the ski slopes from Interlaken requires a bus ride, to Winderwil, followed by a train ride to Lauterbrunn, followed by a different train ride to Wengen, followed by a trip up the Mannlichen Gondola.  Unfortunately after all that trouble the quality of the snow was pretty bad.  The weather here in Interlaken the past couple of days has been unseasonably warm, so the snow is really icy in the morning, turning to slush by mid-day.  Most of the students that followed me out the door of our Hostel (Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof) were beginners.  By the end of the day they were calling themselves the Blue Crew because they were only taking the blue runs.  Note to U.S. skiiers, in the Alps blue is easy, red is intermediate, while black is for experts.  Somehow I got separated from the group right away and ended up doing the first run by myself.  It turned out that they had all skiied a ways ahead of mebut had stopped to contemplate their options in terms of which run to take.  Even after that contemplation they ended up taking a red run, which was not what they wanted to do.  It was during this first run that Aaron took a spill, and tore the ACL, and MCL ligaments in his knee.</p><p>Even though I waited at the bottom and top of the lift hoping to find the group again I was unsuccessful for several runs.  Maybe an hours worth of skiing.  Finally I did see the group coming off the blue run and the first thing I heard was &#8220;have you seen Aaron?&#8221;</p><p>No I said, why?</p><p>He fell and hurt himself on the run.  He told us to go on to the bottom but now we&#8217;re too scared to ski back down to him.</p><p>So, I took my board down the run and found him sitting all by himself by the side of a snow making machine.  Only one person had stopped to see if he needed help, and due to the language barrier apparently determined he was fine.  Meanwhile, I had talked to a couple of ski instructors and managed to locate a ski patrol on a snowmobile.  He joined us on the slope and made the assessment that Aaron was going to need to go to Wengen for some X-Rays.  As we were waiting we decided that we needed a better cover story than falling during the first run of the day.  Hence the Lindsey Vonn reference.  Our story is that she was on the slopes practicing for the world cup race next week and decided to flirt with Aaron, this distracted him momentarily and caused him to crash.  Sadly she did not stop to help or he would probably feel just fine.</p><p>After wrapping Aaron up like a Papoose on the sled behind the snowmobile the patrol took off for the Gondola, and I was supposed to ski down and take the lift back up and meet them there.  By the time I arrived the Gondola had already taken Aaron down, so I had to wait for the next one.  Down in Wengen Aaron got a ride in a taxi to the doctor&#8217;s office and was awaiting an X-ray by the time I arrived.  It only took about an hour and a half at the doctors office to get the X-Ray with the preliminary diagnosis of a torn crucial ligament.  They scheduled a followup appointment the next day so the other doctor could read the X-ray and weigh in.  They outfitted Aaron with a pair of crutches that included flip down spikes for the bottom to aid in navigating through the snow, and we were off.  Aaron with one ski boot on and his crutches, me carrying the other ski boot, his poles, helmet, skiis, and my own board, it was kind of a sad sight to see us slowly trudging through the narrow streets of Wengen back to the Bahnhoff.  Remember all the train and bus stops it took to get to Wengen?  Well we had to do the whole process in reverse loading and offloading skis, boards, etc. at each change.</p><p>Aaron and I made it back to the Hostel, where we began the process of calling our travel insurance company, Luther Study Abroad folks, and Aaron&#8217;s parents.  As I write this we are in &#8220;insurance-limbo&#8221; waiting to hear from our company whether they will cover an MRI in Laussane.  The MRI is critical because it appears that in addition to the torn ligaments there is also a small bone chip.  If the chip is too large or in the wrong place then He&#8217;ll have to go home and get ready for surgery.</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6493300333159428514?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I  write this, I&#8217;ve been up for approximately 36 hours.  My alarm went off yesterday at 3:30AM Minnesota time and it is now 9:45, the next day, in Munich Germany.  Its been a good day, and we&#8217;ve covered a lot of miles, but I am definitely ready for some sleep.  I&#8217;m determined to make it until 10pm our time.</p><p>Its been a long day, and a number of titles for this blog entry have crossed my mind. &#8220;Hurry up and wait&#8221; was the first title that occurred to me as we arrived at the airport at 5:00AM.  The lines to check our bags with American Airlines and get through security were as long as any as I&#8217;ve seen at the Minneapolis airport.  We finally made it through security with just enough time to run down the concourse.  As I arrived at the gate I warned the agent that there were several students in our group that were still behind me.  Cat&#8217;s rather terse response was &#8220;well they have four minutes until I close the door.&#8221;  Cat was well on her way to becoming my favorite person.  Four minutes came and went, and soon all the students were on board.  However the door remained open, and Cat continued to chat with the captain.  After a standard maddeningly long airport style delay the captain finally came on the intercom and told us that there was an indicator light on that was bad enough to keep us on the ground.  He had tried everything except on &#8220;last ditch effort&#8221; to clear the problem.  The captain continued to describe the vehicle that was going to carry us some 30,000 feet in the air over thousands of miles as &#8220;a machine somewhere between a video game and a personal computer&#8221;  So, what do you do when your PC is acting up?  Reboot.  Yes, the captain was going to reboot the airplane in hopes that the problem would magically go away.  The air went off, and the lights went out, and after a few minutes of darkness everything game back to life.  Unfortunately for us the indicator was still on.  So the captain announced we would have to get off the plane so that maintenance could come on board and try to fix the problem.   One of our students forgot his jacket on board the plane so after we were all off he went back aboard to retrieve the jacket.  As he was coming back on board the captain was heard to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the hell is wrong with this plane.&#8221;</p><p>Meanwhile, Craig and I tried to explain to Cat, the friendly agent, that it was very important for us to get to Laguardia in fairly good time as we had to make a transfer to Newark to make our flight to Munich.  Her helpful response was &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you just fly to Newark in the first place?&#8221;  In the end she did say that if the flight was cancelled she could rebook us on a flight through Chicago directly into Newark.  So, I collected bag tags from everyone in case they needed to retrieve our luggage and transfer it to the plane that would be right next door.  The board was showing a 7:30 departure time for our flight, but when 7:15 came around there was no sign of Cat or any update on status.  Finally she came out and announced that we all must board immediately.  Of course one of the students had just left to use the restroom and this caused poor Cat no end of frustration.  Why would they leave the gate area!? she inquired rather crossly.</p><p>In the end all were on board and the flight made it to Laguardia in plenty of time. All the luggage made it as well and so we collected the luggage and made our way to the ground transportation.  We boarded a bus that was supposed to take us directly to Penn station in Midtown where we were going to take a New Jersey rail train to the Newark airport.  However when we got to Grand Central we were told that we needed to transfer to one of the small vans. Unfortunately all 16 of our group would not fit in one van.  After some work a second van came and we got aboard, with a couple of students needing to sit on the floor!  Our driver insisted that we needed to be dropped off on the far side of penn station by the Amtrack lounge even though I repeatedly told him that we needed New Jersey rail.  Once again everything turned out fine and we made our way to Newark, found the group checkin desk and then dispersed for some much needed food. At this point it was about 2:30PM EST and we had not had anything to eat yet.</p><p>The group met back at the gate area for our flight to Munich where we had our first group discussion on the first reading assignment right there.  The students had all done their readings and so the discussion was good.  Boarding for our flight to Munich went smoothly until I discovered that I had a middle middle seat.  Bummer, except that there was an open aisle with an open window right across the way.  I moved into the seat, hoping that nobody would kick me out, and luck was with me.  After a glass of wine and a short movie I was actually able to get in a short nap.</p><p>On we go&#8230; landing, baggage claim, and our trek to the airport train station in Munich all went off without a hitch.  At this point it was 7:30AM Munich time, or just after midnight CST the group was starting to show some signs of getting tired.</p><p><img title="S-bahn to hackerbrüke.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSc91LDMFCI/AAAAAAAAAI4/y7uJYAHp-eI/S-bahn%20to%20hackerbr%C3%BCke.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="S-bahn to hackerbrüke.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p><img title="Olympic Stadium 2.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSc92YOhquI/AAAAAAAAAI8/i_AR9_l3XRc/Olympic%20Stadium%202.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Olympic Stadium 2.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p>Our train ride was about 40 minutes to get to the Hackerbruke station and then it was about a 4 block walk to our Hostel where we were not able to check in yet, but could at least store our luggage before we went out for a long walk around the city.  Craig was an excellent tour guide for our walking tour around Karlsplatz and Marienplatz.  Lunch was a rather expensive stop at the Ratskeller.  I had Weinerschnitzl and fries for 22 euro.  After lunch we took the train to the Olympic Park, where we had a 2:00 tour scheduled, so at this point we are all coming up on the mark where we have been awake for 24 hours.  Our tour guide had us watch a short video on the Olympic park and that is when the head bobbing seriously started.  People were dropping like flies, myself included.  Even after the video as we were standing, yes standing, and looking at a model of the park I found that my chin was suddenly on my chest!  Once we got out and started walking around the park people began to catch a second wind, and the enthusiasm of Ruth, our guide, began to catch on.  Its amazing how much use the Munich Olympic park gets, it is really a model of how to sustainably host the olympics.  Nearly every building is in use today for something, including the famous stadium which up until this year was still used for Bayern Munich soccer club.  They have since moved to the new Allianz stadium, but the stadium continues to be used for concerts and other large events.  We were able to go right now on the field and enjoy the view of the stadium and imagine that we were walking where famous olympians and football stars had also walked.</p><p>After the tour was over, we went up to the top of the Olympic tower where we were treated to a fantastic view of the city, and the Alps in the distance.  With the tour over, people started to get tired again as we took the train back to our Hostel where we were able to check in to our rooms and then get ready to go to dinner.  We kept pushing to keep people awake until a reasonably late hour.  Craig, Aaron, and I went back to Marienplatz to the Andechs Am Dom a brewery where the beer is (or was) brewed by Monks.  I had a delicious dinner of roast pork and huge dumplings.  I&#8217;m pretty sure these are very similar the dumplings that I tried to make for Cenek, our Czech foreign exchange student a couple of years ago.  Its nice to finally see and taste how they are supposed to turn out.  Most of the group went to the Augustiner pub across the road from the hostel, so we stopped there on our way back to the Hostel to join them for another beer before turning in for the night.  This brings me up to date.  The trip is off to a good start but I need sleep badly.</p><p><img title="Distant Alps.jpg" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSc93eNOjhI/AAAAAAAAAJA/4A10QRs1_FU/Distant%20Alps.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Distant Alps.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><p> </p><p><img title="Olympic Village.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSc94R0VqXI/AAAAAAAAAJE/99TIJq_iRQA/Olympic%20Village.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Olympic Village.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6322381603055019358?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t believe that I actually slept until 8:00AM.  After waking up at 3 AM I was afraid I was done for, but I dropped back to sleep and slept hard until 8.  After a quick breakfast at the Hostel it was time for some Munich touring on our own.   A few of us were going to go to the Deutches Museum, but most of the group was headed to Dachau.  I really enjoyed the museum, I went straight to the Math, Computer Science, and Astronomy exhibit, where I discovered that they had an actual Enigma machine, in the cryptography area.</p><p>There were many other great exhibits, the aeronautical area had a cross section of an Airbus A320 and several other interesting aircraft, there was a really amazing mining exhibit as well.  The nautical area was equally amazing with replicas of ships both large and small.  You could easily spend a whole day at the museum, but my mind was pretty overloaded by 11:30.  The plan was to head back to the Viktalien Markt for a street lunch of sausage and bread, unfortunately everything was closed, it turns out that Epiphany is a national holiday in Germany, so we really had to work to find a street vendor that was open.  I had to try the Currywurst, which was a sausage in a sweet sauce with curry powder sprinkled over the top.  It was a delicious German meets Indian fusion street food kind of thing.</p><p>With lunch behind us we met up with the rest of the group to head back to the airport to meet with Sebastian, a marketing guy, from Lufthansa.  He gave us a great presentation on Lufthansa and their support of the Munich 2018 bid.  The Lufthansa folks had very generously provided us all with Munich 2018 stocking hats and scarves.  After the meeting we took a group photo with everyone wearing their new gifts.</p><p><img title="Group 2.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wISL1SSAaEA/TSc98Q_VcqI/AAAAAAAAAJI/KltztXDDBK4/Group%202.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Group 2.jpg" width="400" height="300" />After the Lufthansa meeting we returned to the Hostel for some group discussion and to get ready for our dinner at the Hofbrauhaus!  We were not in the main hall, but were upstairs in their groupdining area.  I had a fantastic dinner of veal ragout with Spaetzel, and a good size dark beer.</p><p>Dinner was pretty calm until a huge group of Canadiens came it.  It was a group of ninth grade hockey players and their parents.  Things really started to heat up when the parents started singing Canadian drinking songs and chugging their beers.  This brought on a resounding L-U, L-U, L-U-T-H, T-H, T-H, T-H-E-R from the Luther crowd and soon we were all friends.</p><p>Back at my room, sleep was hard to come by in this second night.  I mostly drifted in and out of sleep until my alarm went off at 6AM, we needed to be out of the hostel and headed for the train station by 6:45.  As I write this I am on the train to Mannheim and then Interlaken.</p><p> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-446006758223426517?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

Apologies to everyone for the delayed return - it&#8217;s taking me a long while to catch up on everything that built up while I was away.</p>    <p>Proper text processing - specifically, correct handling of unicode - is one of those things that consistently confounds even experienced developers. This isn&#8217;t because it&#8217;s difficult, but rather, I believe, because most developers carry around a few key misconceptions about what text (in the context of software) is and how it&#8217;s represented. A search on StackOverflow for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=unicodedecodeerror">UnicodeDecodeError</a> demonstrates just how prevalent these misconceptions are. These misconceptions date back to the days before unicode - longer than many developers have been in the industry, including myself - but they&#8217;re still nothing if not widespread. This is in part because a number of well known and popular languages continue to, at worst, perpetuate the misunderstandings, and at best are insufficiently good at helping developers get it right.</p>    <p>We can divide languages into four categories along the axis of unicode support:</p>    <ol>  <li>Languages that were written before unicode was defined, or widespread. C and C++ fall into this category. Languages in this category tend to have unicode support that&#8217;s spotty, not built into the language, or difficult to use correctly, making the path of least resistance the wrong one, more often than not.</li>  <li>Languages that should know better. These languages were written after unicode was already widespread, but managed to get things horribly wrong. They have all the weaknesses of category 1, without the excuse of age. Prime amongst these, in my experience, is PHP, though there are doubtless many more languages that do just as badly.</li>  <li>Languages that get it basically right, but have a few critical flaws. Languages in this category are &#8216;modern&#8217; and understand unicode, but fail to make the path of least resistance for developers the correct one, which results in some serious shortfalls in unicode support for things implemented in these languages. Python 2.X, to my dismay, falls into this category - more about which, later.</li>  <li>Languages that Get It Right. They support unicode, and they make it easy to do the right thing, and hard to do the wrong thing. Java and the .NET platform both fall into this category.</li>  </ol>    <p>So what&#8217;s the deal with unicode, and how are we getting it wrong? Joel&#8217;s post, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">the absolute minimum every software developer absolutely, positively must know about unicode</a> is an excellent place to start for this, but for the sake of brevity and those who are naturally impatient, I&#8217;ll summarize.</p>    <h3>Characters and bytes</h3>    <p>The essential fact that you <b>must</b> understand in order to handle text properly is the abstract concept of a character. A character is a representation of a single symbol in a piece of text - a platonic ideal, of sorts. Crucially, a character is <b>not</b> a byte. Let me repeat for emphasis: A character is <b>not, not, not</b> a byte. Furthermore, there&#8217;s no single way of representing a given character as one or more bytes - as I said, a character is the platonic ideal of the smallest unit of text.</p>    <p>Unicode, then, is a way of defining a set of characters that everyone can agree on. It consists of a huge database of characters, and each one is associated with a unique number, called a code point. Thus, the english letter capital A has the codepoint U+0041. The euro symbol has codepoint U+20A0, and so forth. A text string is simply a series of these codepoints, representing the character for each element in the string.</p>    <p>Of course, sooner or later, you need a way to store and transmit your platonic unicode strings. It helps if you choose a method that other people can understand, so that you can send text to them, and they to you, in a mutually comprehensible fashion. This is where character encodings come in.</p>    <p>A character encoding defines a mapping between our platonic characters and some way of representing them as bytes. The mapping doesn&#8217;t have to be complete - it may have no way to represent certain characters - and it doesn&#8217;t need to use the same amount of space for each character - some characters may be encoded as a single byte, while others may require several.</p>    <p>Because there are many ways of representing the same character as bytes, this means that if you have a series of bytes, but do not know their encoding - even if you know the data is textual - the data is meaningless. You can guess, but you&#8217;d be doing just that, guessing. In short, <b>bytes are not text</b>. If you forget everything else in this article, remember that. In order to read and write text, you must first know the encoding you are using, whether from of convention, out of band information, or any other mechanism.</p>    <h3>How Python handles unicode</h3>    <p>This is where Python&#8217;s unicode support comes in. In Python&#8217;s type heirarchy, there are three distinct string types: &#8216;unicode&#8217;, which represents unicode strings (text strings), &#8216;str&#8217;, which represents byte strings (binary data), and &#8216;basestring&#8217;, which acts as a parent class for both of the other string types. This is where, in my opinion, Python makes its misstep in handling unicode which pushes it into category 3, instead of category 4, by my definition above.</p>    <p>As I&#8217;ve just spent several paragraphs belabouring, bytes and characters are fundamentally different entities, only interconvertible with the help of a character encoding. Python, unfortunately, does its best to help you forget this, with two separate missteps:</p>    <p>The first is of debatable significance: treating sequences of bytes as strings. It&#8217;s arguable whether or not this is a good thing; Java and .NET support the proposition that it&#8217;s not, while other languages make good arguments in the other direction. In any case, it&#8217;s certainly true that certain operations you might want to preform on text strings - regular expression matching, string replacement, and so forth - don&#8217;t entirely make sense on sequences of bytes. Python, though, treats bytes as just a different type of string, and allows the same set of operations on both.</p>    <p>The second misstep is the more significant one: Python&#8217;s attempt at transparently converting between byte strings and character strings. In a variety of circumstances, Python will attempt to convert a byte string to a unicode string or vice-versa, when the situation warrants - for example, when attempting to concatenate a byte string and a unicode string together. Since, as we&#8217;ve previously detailed, conversion between the two types is meaningless without an encoding, Python relies on a &#8216;default encoding&#8217;, specified by sys.setdefaultencoding(). On most platforms, this defaults to ASCII, and it&#8217;s almost certainly wrong for any given conversion. Other places this encoding is used include calls to str() or unicode() without specifying an encoding yourself, and functions that expect one type of string but are passed the other.</p>    <p>One solution to some of your unicode woes, then, would be to call sys.setdefaultencoding(), setting the default encoding to whatever you ought to be using. This only masks the root problem, though, which is your failure to handle text correctly in the first place. It may also be impractical, since many apps, particularly webapps, may have to deal with multiple different text encodings in different places.</p>    <p>The correct solution is to fix your code so that you handle text correctly. Here&#8217;s the cliff&#8217;s notes on what you should be doing:</p>    <ul>  <li>All text strings, everywhere should be of type unicode, not str. If you&#8217;re handling text, and your variable is a str, it&#8217;s a bug!</li>  <li>To decode a byte string as text, use var.decode(encoding) (eg, var.decode(&#8216;utf-8&#8217;), with the correct encoding. To encode a text string as bytes, use var.encode(encoding).</li>  <li>Never ever use str() on a unicode string, or unicode() on a byte string without a second argument specifying the encoding.</li>  <li>Whenever you read data from outside your app, expect it to be bytes - eg, of type str - and call .decode() on it to interpret it as text. Likewise, always call .encode() on text you want to send to the outside world.</li>  <li>If a string literal in your code is intended to represent text, it should always be prefixed with &#8216;u&#8217;. In fact, you probably never want to define a raw string literal in your code at all. For what it&#8217;s worth, though, I&#8217;m terrible at this one, as I&#8217;m sure pretty much everyone else is, too.</li>  </ul>    <p>Python 3, by the way, fixes things, and gets unicode and string handling right, putting it solidly into category 4. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit">this section of the What&#8217;s new page</a> for details.</p>    <p>Hopefully this made sense, and if you had any doubts about what exactly unicode is and how to handle it, they&#8217;re now cleared up. Next time you get a UnicodeEncodeError or UnicodeDecodeError in your app, then, you&#8217;ll know exactly what&#8217;s gone wrong, and how to fix it!</p>  <p>  <span>21 July, 2010</span>  </p>    <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2010/07/Getting-unicode-right-in-Python#">Previous Post</a>      <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2010/07/Getting-unicode-right-in-Python#">Next Post</a>        <h3>Comments</h3>  <p>      <a href="http://disqus.com/forums/notdot-blog/?url=ref">View the discussion thread.</a>  <a href="http://disqus.com">blog comments powered by <span>Disqus</span></a>      		</p></div></blockquote>    <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2010/07/Getting-unicode-right-in-Python">blog.notdot.net</a></div> <p>Good article on the issues you encounter when working with strings and unicode in Python.</p></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8099313241295933953?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Dear Apple,<br /><br />You lost a sale today.  I know its just one less iPhone you are going to sell, and in the grand scheme of things does not amount to anything.  I suppose its not really your fault, and as a loyal Apple customer its much easier for me to blame AT&T than you.  Still, it makes me sad to have to tell you this.  I waited as long as I could for AT&T to expand their network in my direction. I&#8217;ve hung on every Verizon rumor for two years.  Finally after enduring a year of carrying my iPod touch in the same pocket as the mind numbingly horrible Motorola Crush I bought an HTC Desire yesterday.  Android!! I never thought I would see the day.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s whats even worse, I like it!  It has some great apps Gmail, Calendar, and many apps that I already love on my iPod Touch and iPad:  Dropbox, Evernote, 1Password, Kindle, Facebook, Twitter, Weather, Stocks, and a 5, yes 5, megapixel camera!  I already love the gps, so the location aware apps work, I love the WiFi and the Bluetooth.<br /><br />I&#8217;m going to miss OmniFocus, but I carry around my Ipad almost everywhere I go so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll miss it that much.<br /><br />So Apple, I&#8217;ll remain a loyal customer, at least for now.  I&#8217;m going to continue to develop my app for the iPad, I still love my iMac and my MacBook Pro.  But if US Cellular comes out with a decent family data plan in the next month or so you may lose two more sales as the rest of my family follows me into the smartphone world.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7948861859540801287?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
