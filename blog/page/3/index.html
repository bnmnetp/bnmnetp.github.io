We had a small mishap this morning. A fork bomb that was meant for a virtual machine accidentally got pasted into a terminal window open to our server.   Now I&#x27;m having an identity crisis.

<p>We passed 3 million entries in our log data for <a href="http://interactivepython.org">InteractivePython.org</a> which got me to wondering about how we are growing.  The site has been live for 275 days.  You can really see how the site took off after day 100, which makes sense because that was bout the time fall classes started around the country.  The tiny plateau between day 225 and 250 corresponds to Christmas/winter break for most schools, and now that Spring semester is in full swing it looks like the slope has gotten steeper again.</p>

<p>The dotted line is the linear best fit line with a slope of 12,836.7.  Even if our log database is not growing exponentially thats an impressively steep slope.</p>

<p>And just because this is all about Python and education, here&#8217;s the Python code that created the graph.  I love matplotlib, it is such a powerful tool for quickly looking at your data.</p>

<pre>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from numpy import polyfit, arange

f = open('bydate','r')
days = f.readlines()
totals = [0]

for d in days:
    day,count = d.split('|')
    count = int(count)
    totals.append(totals[-1]+count)

x = arange(len(totals))
m,b = polyfit(x,totals,1)
print m
plt.plot(x,totals,x,m*x+b, '--k')
plt.ylim(ymin=0)
plt.show()
</pre>

<p>The data file is simple. One day per line with the date in one column and the number of actions in the other column.  Here are the last few days:</p>

<pre>
 2013-02-14 | 24349
 2013-02-15 | 17396
 2013-02-16 | 12645

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Loyal readers will remember that last summer we cruised to Alaska, and some very secretive things were happening on that cruise that I could only refer to rather cryptically.  Well, with the airing of last nights episode of Top Chef the story can now be told.</p>

<p>We were on the set for the filming of the Quickfire challenge onboard the ship!  Although the filming took several hours, we got less than 1 second of screen time.  But here we are!  Brian and I happened to be in a pretty good spot as the camera flashes past us several times.  The ladies we were talking to turned out to be from Wisconsin, in fact from right by our cabin!  The two in the print shirts actually got an additional 2 seconds of screen time along with their comments on the food.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8433342727" title="View 'IMG_0276' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="IMG_0276" alt="IMG_0276" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8354/8433342727_68204d7fdd.jpg" width="500"/></a>

Jane, Brian, and I all made it on again towards the end of the challenge.  Sadly there is no sign of Holly.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8434428742" title="View 'IMG_0277' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="IMG_0277" alt="IMG_0277" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8355/8434428742_32af448c8b.jpg" width="500"/></a>

<p>Of course since this was all way before the show started we had no idea who any of the chefs really were.  I do remember really liking Sheldon&#8217;s lettuce cups as well as Stefan&#8217;s little potato soup cup.  I could swear that I remember seeing Kristin on the ship, so maybe she got to come along since she would be competing in last chance kitchen in Juneau. </p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m looking forward to the finale.  I&#8217;m not sure who I want to win the most, with Stefan and Josie gone all the villains are off the show.  I think it would be awesome if Kristin makes it through LCK and gets to compete against Sheldon or Josh in the Finale.  Thats Josh, by the way, in the first photo.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">Its been a great J-Term.  A trip to Vail for some Skiing, **and** a trip to Florida to solve the worlds problems with great friends at the DeBary Institute.  For those who do not know, the DeBary institute is a newly renowned think tank with roots in the Bone Lake Global Institute.

We arrived on Friday and spent a wonderful late afternoon enjoying the hospitality and home of our host, Tim Peter.

On Saturday we toured Stetson University in the morning.

Later we repaired to Smyrna Beach, it was a bit windy but we enjoyed it all the same.

The culinary highlight of our trip was dinner at the Swamp House Grill and Tiki Bar.  We enjoyed some lovely alligator bites as appetizers:

After dinner we sat around enjoying the music of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/markdmooreoriginals">Mark Moore</a>.

Sunday was Football (European and American) and then Golf day.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8405887790" title="View 'IMG_0245' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="IMG_0245" alt="IMG_0245" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8516/8405887790_1e84e19b80.jpg" width="500"/></a>

Dinner was provided by Gregory and Brad who made a charming seafood alfredo.

Monday morning we left the house at 5:50AM.   The temperature was 62 degrees.  Five hours later we arrived in Cedar Rapids where the temperature was -2.  Thats a big swing for a monday morning.

Already looking forward to next year!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided that it will be best to keep my personal blog separate from the new Everyday Python blog project.  All of the infrastructure to make the posts interactive just work so much better when I have control of the server and everything else.  So  You can head over to <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/everyday">Everyday Python</a> and click on the Everyday Python link there, or if you want to subscribe to the RSS feed for that project you can use <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/everydaypython">this link</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got back from four awesome days of skiing in Vail and Beaver Creek.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8370576743" title="View 'Vail 2013' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="Vail 2013" alt="Vail 2013" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8079/8370576743_c4f2dc7325.jpg" width="500"/></a>

<p>The Colorado resorts have a really cool new way of handling the ski passes, instead of clipping a tag on your jacket you now get a credit card with an RFID chip in it.  Talk about a ski pass that appeals to the Geek in me!  But whats even better is that every time you go on a lift, there is an RFID reader that grabs your ID and logs that lift ride.  So now at the end of the day you can go on to a website and see how many vertical feet you skiied that day.  Very cool.  Over our four days of skiing we did just over 95,000 vertical feet!  If we&#8217;d only known how close to 100k we would get we surely would have had a shorter lunch break on day one!</p>
<p>Since snow started late and has been a bit sparse since Christmas there was a lot of snow making going on.  The mounds of snow created by the snow machines remind you of a Dr. Seuss drawing:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8370575981" title="View 'Vail 2013' on Flickr.com"><img height="241" title="Vail 2013" alt="Vail 2013" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8370575981_cdf794cd8c.jpg" width="500"/></a>
</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pleased to say that my skiing has really improved thanks to my Solomon BBR 8.9 skis.  I&#8217;ve started to call them my magic skis because I can even do the moguls!  Here&#8217;s a picture I took of craig at the top of one particularly narrow and moguly run.  Note that I got down first with enough time to turn around and snap some pictures.

<p>Here&#8217;s another shot of Craig just before he jumped off the cliff.  Note once again who went first to take the picture:   :-)
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8370575729" title="View 'Vail 2013' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="Vail 2013" alt="Vail 2013" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8470/8370575729_b21214285b.jpg" width="500"/></a> </p>

<p>All in all it was a great four days of skiing with the guys.  Can&#8217;t wait until next year. </p>

<h1>Everyday Python<a class="headerlink" href="#everyday-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It is always risky to make your New Years resolutions public, but this is one I&#8217;ve
been thinking about for a while now, and so I&#8217;m going to go ahead and impose a
measure of accountability on myself by proclaiming this publicly.  This week, I&#8217;m
starting a series of educational blog posts here, and as a part of my <a class="reference external" href="http://interactivepython.org">Runestone
Interactive</a> publishing project.</p>
<p>My idea is to publish a series of Python programming projects, aimed at solving
everyday problems, or puzzles. Hopefully these little projects will be interesting
and will give learners motivation to dig into the details of the solutions.  I
will provide links to the relevant Python programming constructs and data types in
either of the two interactive books (<a class="reference external" href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html">How to think like a computer scientist:
Interactive Edition</a> , or
<a class="reference external" href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html">Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python</a>) This will let me
focus on the problems, and not the minutia of the language.  Lets face it, reading
about all the different possible string methods is not that exciting, but seeing
them in action, and then wondering about what else you might be able to do with
strings is OK.</p>
<p>The great thing about Python is that if you write things in a straightforward
manner its pretty easy to follow even if you don&#8217;t know all the details.  So, that
is my intention.  Write a solution and do it in straightforward Python that
beginners can understand.  Each project will appear over several days, and
will likely include some homework related to the project.  I&#8217;ll provide the solution
in a followup post.  In addition, I may refine the solution over the course of
several days introducing more and interesting solutions or more advanced features
of the Python language.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind I am drawing inspiration from the old <em>Communications of the ACM</em> column by John
Bently called <em>Programming Pearls</em> In John&#8217;s columns he would feature a particular
problem or algorithm, and present it in a straight forward way, but then he would
refine that solution again and again polishing it until he had an incredibly
elegant solution.  It was beautiful because even a novice programmer could
understand what was going on at the start of the article, but would get sucked in
to the beautiful solution and would learn more than they thought possible.  While
advanced programmers might chuckle at the initial solutions, even they would have
to admit that they learned something by the end of each column.</p>
<p>I already have a few ideas in mind for the first few projects.  I&#8217;m going to try
to start fairly easy with some string and list kind of projects, and work my way up
to more complex problems and algorithms, again this is meant to be educational so
that in theory a beginner might read through these posts more or less
chronologically, and learn some computer science along the way.</p>
