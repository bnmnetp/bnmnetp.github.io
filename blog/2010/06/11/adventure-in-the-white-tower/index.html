<div class="entry-content">Today&#8217;s travel adventure involved the Tower of London.  No, we were not arrested and tortured by the English royalty.  We were on a tour of the tower of london.  We had just finished the guided tour with one of the Yoman Warders (cool title eh?) and we decided to go in and check out the Armoury. (yep I&#8217;m converting to british spelling)  Just after we got in the door an alarm started to go off, and a woman steward came hurrying buy and told us that we had to evacuate the tower.  We were never able to to find out why we had to evacuate but Jane overheard a couple of them talking about a fire alarm.  The tower of London is also the site where Henry VIII beheaded several of his wives, including Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />We started our day by taking the tube to St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral.  After walking around the sanctuary we resumed our european stair climbing tradition.  We first walked 257 stairs to the whispering gallery.  This is a cool balcony where you can face the wall and whisper.  The person standing directly opposite you across the circle, over 100 feet away, can hear you perfectly clearly.  I&#8217;d like to explain the physics of this but I&#8217;m told that my readership will decline if I include any equations.  I guess all three of you are safe and will remain loyal readers.  After the whispering gallery we continued another 266 stairs up to the gold gallery.  From here we had a very good, but slightly foggy view of all of London.  <br /><br />Next we walked across the Millennium bridge and toured Shakespeare&#8217;s Globe theater.  This is a slightly modernized version of the original, but still true to the spirit of performing plays in daylight where the actors and audience are face to face.  It would have been really fun to try to watch a show there, but Macbeth is being performed at the moment and it seemed a bit dark, and long given our schedule for the day.<br /><br />Now we are chilling at our hotel, the Luna Simone, watching Mexico and South Africa play futbol.  South Africa just scored and are up one nil.  Very exciting for the South African side.  We have been researching whether or not we dare show the american colors during the game tomorrow.  Research has indicated that the scottish people will cheer for ANY opponent of England, so we feel pretty comfortable about watching the game in a pub in Ediburgh tomorrow.  Maybe some nice scottish people will buy us a pint if we win!   (darn, Mexico just scored)<br /><br />Kaia is waiting patiently for her phone call from her Concordia advisor to do her registration!  Then we&#8217;ll grab a quick dinner and head out to see Billy Elliot at the Victoria Palace Theater.  We had three shows that we wanted to see while we were in London and this one won out since we walked right by the box office last night.  We also wanted to see Stomp, and We Will Rock You. Yes, a Queen musical, featuring Bohemian Rhapsody and of course We Will Rock You.<br /> <br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=London,%20England&z=10'>London, England</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3408176807179586741?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
