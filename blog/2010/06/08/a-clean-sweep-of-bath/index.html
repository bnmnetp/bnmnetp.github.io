<div class="entry-content">Yesterday we flew from Chicago to London.  We tried a day flight instead of an overnight flight and it worked very well.  We left Chicago at 9:05AM and arrived at Heathrow at 10:30PM.  The flight was very easy an non-eventful, it worked perfect for someone who cannot fall asleep on an airplane.  We got into Heathrow and did the customs thing and by the time we got to our hotel it was after midnight.  To our bodies it was still early evening but by 1:30 we all had lights out and were working on sleep.<br /><br />We did sleep in until 8:45 this morning.  From there we took off for Bath by way of Stonehenge.  For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Stonehenge is a big circle of rocks.  Merlin the magician moved them down from Ireland sometime in the distant past.  This was well before King Uther died, because he is apparently buried in Stonehenge.  Here&#8217;s Kaia and Josh at Stonehenge.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1857.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1857.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />At lunchtime we at at a local establishment called Jacqueline&#8217;s Bistro.  Jane and Kaia had fresh baked baguettes with goat cheese, Josh had a ham and cheese omelet with salad and I had fish and chips.<br /><br />From there we moved on to our final destination for today, Bath.  When you arrive in downtown Bath you are &#8220;in a twisty turny maze&#8221;  Its hard to know where you are, and the gps was equally unenlightened at several points.  When we finally did find the parking lot where we were supposed to leave our car, it was closed for re-surfacing!  So we had to go back to find a different lot that we had passed along the way.<br /><br />After parking the car it was a very short walk to our Bed & Breakfast at Three Abbey Green. We have a beautiful two room suite, so we have to room to spread out tonight.  Josh and Kaia both have their own beds and Kaia gets a separate bedroom.  Breakfast is included as part of the deal in the morning.  Here&#8217;s a nice view of the courtyard and our place for the night.  The entrance is to the left of the giant tree in this photo:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1858.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1858.jpg' border='0' width='187' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />We went out to view the sites of Bath, its a great downtown area once you are on foot.  We visited the Roman Baths - from whence Bath got its name  - and looked at the Abbey.  Went shopping to replace the shorts that I left hanging on the back of the bathroom door at the Super 8 in Chicago.  On the recommendation of our hotelier we went to the Eye of India for some great Indian food for dinner.  We had Tikki Takka Tak, (I&#8217;m not making that up) Garlic Chili Masala, and Chicken Khorma, along with rice and nan.  Here&#8217;s Kaia and Jane at the Baths.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/1859.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/08/s_1859.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />The highlight of the day was definitely the after dinner show, called Bazaar Bath.  Its a comedy/magic show that roams around downtown.  The host entertains by poking fun of the people on the tour and doing tricks.  As advertised, you do not learn anything about the history or culture of Bath, but it is a lot of laughs and I highly recommend this show if you come to Bath.<br /><br />Unfortunately our string of injuries continues  as Jane seems to have slipped a disc as we were walking around for the show tonight.  Hopefully ibuprofen and heat will have her back as good as new in the morning.<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bath,%20England&z=10'>Bath, England</a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8985996883290673845?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>
