    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its been a great J-Term.  A trip to Vail for some Skiing, <strong>and</strong> a trip to Florida to solve the worlds problems with great friends at the DeBary Institute.  For those who do not know, the DeBary institute is a newly renowned think tank with roots in the Bone Lake Global Institute.</p>

<p>We arrived on Friday and spent a wonderful late afternoon enjoying the hospitality and home of our host, Tim Peter.</p>

<p>On Saturday we toured Stetson University in the morning.</p>

<p>Later we repaired to Smyrna Beach, it was a bit windy but we enjoyed it all the same.

<p>The culinary highlight of our trip was dinner at the Swamp House Grill and Tiki Bar.  We enjoyed some lovely alligator bites as appetizers:

<p>After dinner we sat around enjoying the music of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/markdmooreoriginals">Mark Moore</a>.</p>

<p>Sunday was Football (European and American) and then Golf day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71706244@N00/8405887790" title="View 'IMG_0245' on Flickr.com"><img height="375" title="IMG_0245" alt="IMG_0245" border="0" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8516/8405887790_1e84e19b80.jpg" width="500"/></a></p>

<p>Dinner was provided by Gregory and Brad who made a charming seafood alfredo.</p>

<p>Monday morning we left the house at 5:50AM.   The temperature was 62 degrees.  Five hours later we arrived in Cedar Rapids where the temperature was -2.  Thats a big swing for a monday morning.</p>

<p>Already looking forward to next year!</p>
