    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My daughter Kaia is getting married next summer.  This is not new news, the proposal was made an accepted last June.  But planning is in full swing now, and I was kind of excited when secured a visit with Capsule, because capsule provides a service where all the guests at your wedding can download the capsule app and it will automatically upload all the photos to a special page for the wedding.</p>

<p>This company was founded by Cyrus, who set out to solve a simple problem, a problem we&rsquo;ve been coping with on this course as well.  When you travel, how do you share all your digital photos with the buddies you are traveling with.  When you have a big party?  When you have a wedding, bachelor party, bachelorette party?  Capsule has solved this in a nice, elegant way.  All the photos uploaded for a particular event, are shared with the participants in the event.  Its that easy.  No need to bore all of your Facebook followers with every photo from your trip.  If you&rsquo;re an Instagram user, its super easy to add a special hashtag to your photo and it will be automatically imported into Capsule as well as shared on Instagram.</p>

<p>What was incredibly interesting for me was to listen to Cyrus talk about business models, and monetizing the service.  Cyrus is not a CS guy, he&rsquo;s a business guy.  Of course as an entrepreneur he can talk the tech talk but his home is on the business side.  Here&rsquo;s an example of how differently we tech people approach a problem than the business guys.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Each event needs to have a unique id, that can be given to the participants to use to join the event, and/or tag their Instagram photos.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Solution:</strong> Ha, this is easy, we&rsquo;ll just allow people to pick a unique identifier, lets say <code>#TannerAndKaia</code> No problem, this is easy just give them a text entry box, and a quick database lookup to make sure the hashtag hasn&rsquo;t already been taken.  No big deal, even an intern could code this up.</p>

<p><strong>Business Guy Solution:</strong>  Ok, just generate a random hashtag <code>#JK286TJ</code>.  Now if the bride and the groom want to have a nice hashtag for their wedding, we can sell them that as a strategy to monetize the service.</p>

<p>Brilliant!  We tech guys get so focused on the solution most of the time that we never stop to think about simple strategies to monetize.</p>

<p>Our second visit of the day was to <a href="http://fullscreen.net" title="Fullscreen">Fullscreen</a>.  This is a Culver City company that employs three Luther Alumni!  Two of which I am very proud to say are also alumni of this very course.  Drew is employee number 3 of Fullscreen, and Aaron is number 15, Jacob is not far after Aaron.  Fullscreen now numbers over 220 employees, and is a very fast growing new media company.</p>

<p>What do they do?  What do you mean new media company?  Well, this is where my age really starts to show.  Apparently there are people in this world that spend a lot of time watching &ldquo;shows&rdquo; on youTube.  Shows like that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles" title="JennaMarbles">Marbles girl</a>, or teenagegirl14, and thousands of others.  As Aaron said, this is not your demographic Brad, this is targeted at a group of people that will probably never pay a cable bill.  So Fullscreen is a Network in the sense that they aggregate all kinds of these new generation entertainers, and help them monetize their videos on youtube.  Note that monetize is a euphemism for ad serving, but thats really only a small part of what Fullscreen is about.  Its a great company and Drew, Aaron, and Jacob were excellent hosts.  They even talked their CEO into spending about an hour with us answering questions.</p>

<p>Another interesting story around Fullscreen is that Drew and George (CEO of Fullscreen) met at Coloft Santa Monica.  We were also lucky enough to meet with the founder of Coloft, Avesta, (@avestar). He gave the students  a great no-nonsense talk on his views of entrepreneurship. The story of Drew meeting George is a great example of the synergies that can happen in a co-working facility.  At the time, Drew and a partner were trying to start a little consulting company to do coding for hire.  Avesta happened to be talking to George who was looking for someone with Drew&rsquo;s skill set.  So he introduced the two of them, and a successful company was launched.</p>

<p>I love this story on a couple of different levels.  First, as a professor I take pride in the success and accomplishments of my students even after they leave the campus.  As an alum and faculty member of a college that counts community as one of its defining characteristics, it is great to find other organizations that lift up community as a differentiator.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Curiosity is the cure for boredom.  There is no cure for curiosity.  We began our day with a visit to PR firm, Schwartz MSL, Bryan Scanlon gave the group a great overview of the players in the PR space and how PR companies work.   The tagline for their group may be something like &ldquo;telling stories that matter.&rdquo; I like this and it resonates well with a lot of the career advice people are sharing with the students.</p>

<p>In fact Bryan told a great story about his brother that really helped emphasize the message that you have to find a real world outlet for your skills and then use your skills to develop something real, something that you can tell a story about. <!-- more --></p>

<p>Bryan&rsquo;s story was that at an interview for an engineering job his brother was asked to glue together two PVC pipes.  A pretty practical, maybe even mundane, task for someone applying for an engineering job.  However his brother took stock of the situation and said he couldn&rsquo;t do it.  &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the interviewer.  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any cleaning fluid&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;without cleaning fluid I can&rsquo;t do a proper job and the joint won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;  He was hired.</p>

<p>Lunch time was great as Gage, Dylan, and I went to an Irish pub called Irish Times.  The outstanding feature of this pub is that they had the Arsenal game on all of the TVs during lunch today.  The arsenal were taking on Aston Villa, in a game we needed to win to retake &ldquo;top of the table.&rdquo;  In a stroke of good luck I got to see both Arsenal goals before we had to take off for our afternoon meeting.</p>

<p>The afternoon meeting was at Hatch Today, a co-working space that houses many many small companies.  We visited for over an hour with Eric, one of the co-founders of Sqwiggle.  Eric is young, energetic, has a thousand side projects going, and is the epitome of young founders here in the area.</p>

<p>The software that sqwiggle produces is somewhat like Google Hangouts, but the video is only in black and white and only updates every 10 seconds, unless you are actively in a conversation with a co-worker.  The idea is you can have sqwiggle on all day, without using a ton of bandwidth, and your fellow workers can see when you are in your office.  If they need to have a quick conversation, they just double click on you.  This allows for good interaction in a company that is totally distributed.  Sqwiggle is a great example of such a company.  One founder is in the UK, one in San Francisco, and one of their developers is Luther alum Cam Webb, currently in Atlanta, but soon to move to Des Moines.  I think many of us were skeptical of the idea until we met with Eric, saw it in action, and learned a bit more.</p>

<p>Many of the themes we&rsquo;ve been hearing about were repeated by Eric this afternoon, but I would like to highlight one that has not been mentioned yet.  <strong>Measurement</strong>  Eric showed us the company dashboard.  Very cool, how many user, how many paying users, how many active users, revenue per month.  All great metrics to run the business by.  In addition he talked about other metrics they are collecting relative to the details of the software.  This is a really important lesson.  If you want to really improve something, you need to measure it.  For example, bandwidth usage, number of active users in a conversation, you need to set goals, and then work on designing your software to meet those goals.</p>
