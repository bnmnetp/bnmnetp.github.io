    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know those yellow lines on the football field?  They are harder to draw than they look.  Think for a minute about all of the different field conditions.  Natural green turf, artificial turf, mud, snow, cold brown grass.  Now think about all of the different colored uniforms the players wear.  Now, look closely.  The line never covers up any part of a player, or the ball.  Notice that?  The ball doesn&rsquo;t have a yellow strip, the ball blocks out the yellow line.  The same with players shoes.  Today we got to learn about the yellow lines, the blue lines, the down and distance information,  and many more cool effects that Sportvision puts on our television screens.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the group on the &ldquo;practice Field&rdquo;  They were moving the blue and the yellow line for us as we stood there. You can kind of see them on the big screen on the wall.  The rack of equipment behind me is what they need to bring to each game, and the computers on the desk are whats used by the operator during the game.  The operator can adjust all sorts of parameters based on field conditions and uniform colors etc.  In addition, in the case of a really bad snow storm, they can also project all the yard markers on top of the snow so the people at home have a better view of the field than the players.</p>

<p>In addition to football, Sportvision is also a big provider of on screen information for NASCAR and Major League Baseball.  In the case of NASCAR they display a box of statistics right above the car as it goes around the track.  For Major League Baseball, they show the ball and strike zone, and a bunch of statistics about pitch placement.  They also collect statistics about every player on the diamond.  They track the ball and the players using an array of cameras placed around the ballpark.  Here&rsquo;s where the cool math and physics comes in.  Based on the flight of the ball, they compute the spin!  The cameras are not good enough yet to track the laces, but with some math, they can provide a visualization of how the ball is spinning!  Very cool.</p>

<p>Sportvision is looking at lots of sports, and looking at newer ways to get more information about every player.  For example Football players may have special chips embedded in their shoulder pads someday in the future.  NASCAR cars already have a special box in them that tracks all kinds of information for Sportvision, Soccer players are not likely to have any special chips as it would likely inhibit their play, unless something could be put in their shoes.</p>

<p>Like most of the companies we have met with Big Data is an important part of Sportvision&rsquo;s  future plans.  Right now their main customers are the television networks, but in the future individual teams will pay for data.  One interesting aspect of the big data strategy for Sportvision is that they don&rsquo;t have to productize the analytics part of it. The reason is because most teams just want the data, and they consider the analytics to be a competitive advantage.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean that Sportvision won&rsquo;t productize some analysis software, because there is a market at the college level and below where teams can&rsquo;t afford to pay for their own data scientists.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What?  There is no real way to know the answer to this question, but it is one that was posed to the group today.  How do you handle uncertainty?  How do well do you think on your feet?  This is a typical interview question used by many high tech companies.  At Luther we might ask prospective faculty, &ldquo;how many cornstalks in the state of Iowa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question definitely stumped a few people in the room, but others got the idea quickly. <!-- more --> This question isn&rsquo;t about getting the right answer.  There is a right answer, but nobody could tell you exactly what it is.  There is definitely a wrong answer:  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Its not possible.&rdquo; are two examples of the wrong answer to this question.</p>

<p>So what do you do?  You have to make some assumptions.  What fraction of the state of Washington is forested, what is the density of trees in the forested area.  If you use some reasonable numbers for those two items you can make a reasonable, and defensible estimate.  That is something that startups have to do every day.  Use the information they have available, and make their best guess.  Check the assumptions, and be ready to refine the answer.  This is not just true of startups, it is true for all businesses, projects, and life.</p>

<p>Here are a few more highlights and themes from today:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you interview, have a story.  I&rsquo;ve been telling my students this for the last several years, but it is much more compelling when you hear it from someone who is actually making hiring decisions.  The story should be based around something you have built or designed yourself.</li>
<li>You can have the best technology and still fail in many different ways.</li>
<li>What is the one core competency of your company?  Starbucks was not coffee, it was training, so that customers had a consistent experience.  McDonalds was not making burgers, but rather distribution.</li>
<li>Finally, it takes four kinds of people to make a successful startup:

<ul>
<li>The Visionary</li>
<li>The Builder</li>
<li>The Designer</li>
<li>The Closer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>One person may take on multiple of these roles, but you have to have them all in order to be successful as a company.  The Visionary is of course the person who is looking ahead five years and setting the direction.  The Builder, owns the solution space.  Builders are part of a spectrum.  Architects &mdash; Hackers.  Architects want to have a good strong lasting implementation, and tend to plan the whole system out before coding.  Hackers, tend to code as they think, and the best of them have an idea coded by the end of the meeting where it was first introduced.  Where are you on that spectrum?  The Designers interpret the vision to the builders, they own the problem space, and understand the user experience.  In the best case, the builder and the designer are the same person.  Finally, the Closer, usually a sales person, often also the CEO is the person who can close the deal.</p>

<ul>
<li>The better a company is at serving their customers, the less likely the are to change.  This of course goes against every lesson Steve Jobs and others like him taught us.  You need to make yourself obsolete before someone else does.  In an aside, I think this lesson right here is the achilles heel of higher education.</li>
</ul>
