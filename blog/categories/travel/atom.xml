    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two days of skiing at Tahoe are in the bag, but what a difference between the two days.  Yesterday we got the true spring skiing experience.  It was cool and crusty in the morning and a bit slushy in the afternoon.  Its been a pretty bad winter here in Tahoe so a lot of the runs were not accessible.  In the morning we went up the Stagecoach express and turned left, to try the Stagecoach run.  It was the worst skiing I have ever experienced in my life.  Thankfully, we learned the trick.  Stay on the groomed runs!  Once we figured that out the day was a blast, if a bit repetitive.  One thing you can&rsquo;t beat is the views.  Bright sunny day, clear blue sky, good friends to ski with.  What could be better?</p>

<p>I also love this photo for all of the layers.  High clouds, low clouds, shadows of clouds on the brown/green valley floor below.</p>

<p>Overnight, the winds kicked in, and the snow came down.  Up to eight inches in the higher elevations.  This made for a second day of mid-winter like skiing.  Suddenly, all the runs that were not good yesterday were very ski-able with a fresh layer of snow.  The only downside was that the winds and snow continued.  We were told in the morning that all the lifts might have to shut down, at some point because thunder (and lightning) were in the forecast for the day.  I&rsquo;ve never thought about being up on a ski lift in a thunderstorm before but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>

<p>In any case, if they do shut down certain of the lifts, then you are in trouble anyway&hellip;</p>

<p>Lake Tahoe is beautiful.  We arrived last night from Napa and got to our VRBO home, it is great and we had a beautiful view of the lake out our windows.  The sun was just going down and I captured this picture of the Sequoia outside our window.</p>

<p><a href="http://flic.kr/p/mouxs6" title="Camera Roll-482 by -bnmnetp-"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2840/13381667205_c6d0cc90bf_z.jpg" width="478" height="640" alt="Camera Roll-482"></a></p>

<p>Today we drove the east side of the lake and met Jim and Karen for lunch, then we went to Emerald bay in the afternoon after Pete and Kim joined us.  Its really hard to describe or write too much about this, so I will just add a few photos here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Brought to You by the Letter &lsquo;C&rsquo;</h3>

<p>I must confess, after all of the Chardonnay I&rsquo;ve consumed, and I have consumed my share over the years, I have never really got the &ldquo;buttery oaky Chardonnay&rdquo; thing.  Butter is just not something I&rsquo;ve ever tasted in my Chardonnay, despite the fact that one of my all time favorites is Rombaur, which according to more than one person in Napa, is the &ldquo;poster child&rdquo; for buttery oaky Chardonnays. Really, who wants their Chardonnay to taste like butter?  The whole describing wine thing is another thing I find really interesting.  One of the tasting room hosts, recommended the movie <em>Somm</em> to us as we were chatting.  I see you can get/rent it on iTunes, so I&rsquo;m adding that to my list.  Its about a group of guys preparing for the master sommelier exam, which may sound a bit dull, but the reviews for it are fantastic.</p>

<p>But after two days of tastings in Napa its all clear to me now.  The key that helped me understand the difference, and I&rsquo;m confident I&rsquo;m now an expert, is Malolactic Fermentation.  The science of it all, unsurprisingly, has stuck in my brain.  Here&rsquo;s a quick summary of more than you ever probably wanted to know.</p>

<p>Malolactic Fermentation is the process of converting Malic Acid (which tastes tart,and citrussy to my mouth) to Lactic Acid which is a much more mellow flavor.  Malolactic fermentation occurs after fermentation and is the result of injecting a particular bacteria into the process.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2877/13381848063_83f9dd310c.jpg" alt="William Hill" /></p>

<p>Now, to each his own, but I can say that I am a fan of Malolactic Fermentation.  Here are some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rombaur</li>
<li>William Hill</li>
<li>Carpe Deim</li>
<li>Poseidon&rsquo;s Vineyard</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conquering the Tannins</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to drink red wine much due to my allergies.  What am I allergic to in red wine?  Tannin is a chemical that comes from the skins, seeds, and stems of the wine.  They are much more prevalent in red wine than in white.  Now according to our host at Chateau Montelena (see also the movie Bottle Shock) I need to develop a resistance to Tannins in order to drink red wine.  The way to do this, according to this would be allergist, is to begin with Pinot Noir, and work my way up from there.  Well it sounds like a project, and I do enjoy a nice glass of Pinot.  So, something to work on.  All in the name of self improvement of course.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I left home on December 27 2013.  When I left I had 3 bags packed.  One for our trip to Mazatlan to celebrate the new year with our friends the Vermace&rsquo;s.  One for my January term class on the west coast, and finally a bag full of ski gear for the rest and relaxation trip to Breckenridge.  Since leaving home I have travelled a bit over 10,000 miles.  My means of travel has included several flights, two long train trips on Amtrak, some time in a car, and lots of time on public transportation.</p>

<p>In the last 35 days I&rsquo;ve had more experiences than many people would have in a lifetime.  I say this out of a sense of gratitude, and to remind myself how lucky I am.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve body surfed in the Pacific Ocean on the beach in front of our rented house in Mazatlan called the Sand Castle.  Calling the Sand Castle a house is a bit of an understatement.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/BodySurf.jpg" alt="" />

<ul>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been deep sea fishing, and reeled in a large Dorado (Mahi Mahi), which was cleaned dockside, and prepared on the grill at the Sand Castle just hours later.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve toasted the New Year watching fireworks over the beach from the fourth floor of the Sand Castle.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/MazNY.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a group of 11 Luther Students well, and watched as they talked with and learned from some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the country.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve had four days in Seattle to visit Pike Place Market, eat seafood, visit Pioneer Square.  During the same period we visited Amazon, Microsoft, VMWare, and Percognate.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Amtrak from Seattle to San Francisco promised spectacular views and a comfortable ride.  While the ride was comfortable, if I did it again, I would definitely spring for sleeper cars for the group.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve had four days on Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, led a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, and beyond Suasalito.  While in San Francisco we visited Strava, Pinterest, Moovweb, Bizo, Sqwiggle, Schwartz MSL, and Hummer Winblad.</p></li>
</ul>

<img src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had four days in Menlo Park, including a 32 mile bike ride up Old La Honda road and along Skyline drive.  I introduced the group to turkish food at Sultana restaurant.  While in Menlo Park we spent a day at Google, a morning at SportVision, and learned about patent law at Fenwick West.</li>
</ul>

<img src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary11.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>The train ride from San Jose to Los Angeles lived up to its billing.  The views were spectacular, and we got to see an amazing sunset over the Pacific.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary13.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>To cap off our trip we stayed in a house called Beethoven&rsquo;s Trio in Santa Monica.  Rather than eating out we were able to use the grill and the kitchen and prepare our own communal meals.  It was fun to watch the students cook (and clean up) and eat in a very casual setting.</p></li>
<li><p>We got to spend the weekend exploring Venice Beach and anything else in the LA area.  Sunday morning I met a group of Chelsea fans at a local British pub.  A fun way to get my soccer fix for the week.</p></li>
<li><p>While in Santa Monica we visited with Capsule, Coloft, and Fullscreen.  At Fullscreen we were hosted by three Luther alumni two of whom took the Entrepreneurship course and did the journey three four years ago.  It is so gratifying to see your students succeed.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary14.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="/images/JTerm14/JT14Summary15.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Finally I&rsquo;ve been able to spend six days &ldquo;recuperating&rdquo; in Breckenridge.  Some might say that five days of skiing is hardly recuperating, and I would agree.  However, we have had 30+ inches of fresh snow in the last three days, and the locals say this is one of the greatest storms ever.  So to say that the skiing has been fantastic is a bit of an understatement.</li>
</ul>

<p>After all of this, perhaps the best thing is that I get to go home tomorrow.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-30T16:45:02-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://reputablejournal.com/blog/2014/01/30/on-14-inches-of-powder</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The weather report said we had 6 inches of snow overnight.  From the moment we walked out the door it was clear that they had underestimated the snowfall by about 8 inches.</p>

<p><img src="/images/JTerm14/BreckPowder.jpg" alt="Powder" /></p>

<p>We were on the third chair up at 8:30 this morning.  The steep parts of the hill were awesome, with powder over my knees, floating through the snow.  On the gentle parts of the hill we all formed a single file line in order to get through it all.</p>

<p>By mid-day it was work.  The powder had been packed in many places and it was work to get through it.  The snow continued heavily throughout the day, and we are supposed to get another 14 inches overnight.</p>

<p>This has been the perfect few days of rest and relaxation to finish off January term.  Its even better because we bought the Epic local passes this year, which means we don&rsquo;t feel like we have to ski full time, but can actually just ski until we are ready to take a break, and then ski again later.  Its been great.</p>
